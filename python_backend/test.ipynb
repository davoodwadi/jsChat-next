Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions of these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited hgih convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significnatly correlated with both self-reported current usage r = .63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage r = .85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage r = .45, Study 1) and future usage r = .59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a signficnatly greater correaltion with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecdent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.'},\n",

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.'},\n",

This paper attempts to offer a broader definition of big data that captures its other unique and defining characteristics. The rapid evolution and adoption of big data by industry has leapfrogged the discourse to popular outlets, forcing the academic press to catch up. Academic journals in numerous disciplines, which will benefit from a relevant discussion of big data, have yet to cover the topic. This paper presents a consolidated description of big data by integrating definitions from practitioners and academics. The paper's primary focus is on the analytic methods used for big data. A particular distinguishing feature of this paper is its focus on analytics related to unstructured data, which constitute 95% of big data. This paper highlights the need to develop appropriate and efficient analytical methods to leverage massive volumes of heterogeneous data in unstructured text, audio, and video formats. This paper also reinforces the need to devise new tools for predictive analytics for structured big data. The statistical methods in practice were devised to infer from sample data. The heterogeneity, noise, and the massive size of structured big data calls for developing computationally efficient algorithms that may avoid big data pitfalls, such as spurious correlation.\"},\n",

However, it is not clear how \"gamification\" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate \"gamification\" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts.

If the expected profit from a customer is greater than the cost of marketing to her, the marketing action for that customer is executed. So far, work in this area has considered only the intrinsic value of the customer (i.e, the expected profit from sales to her). We propose to model also the customer's network value: the expected profit from sales to other customers she may influence to buy, the customers those may influence, and so on recursively. Instead of viewing a market as a set of independent entities, we view it as a social network and model it as a Markov random field. We show the advantages of this approach using a social network mined from a collaborative filtering database. Marketing that exploits the network value of customers---also known as viral marketing---can be extremely effective, but is still a black art. Our work can be viewed as a step towards providing a more solid foundation for it, taking advantage of the availability of large relevant databases.\"},\n",

Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers.A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context ofthe task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer.Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers' data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers' experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity, and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present pilot experiments with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. Our inhouse commercial hotel marketing platform, eXclusivi, was extended with a new software module working with ChatGPT prompts and persuasive ads created for its recommendations. In particular, we developed an intelligent advertisement (ad) copy generation tool for the hotel marketing platform. The proposed approach allows for the hotel team to target all guests in their language, leveraging the integration with the hotel’s reservation system. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between ChatGPT and persuasive technology in recommender systems, ultimately influencing guest satisfaction and hotel revenue.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Alzheimer disease (AD) drug development has a high failure rate. Drug development decision making can be improved based on lessons learned from past trials. Improved interpretation of animal models, better pharmacologic characterization in phase I and phase II trials, appropriate sample size, diagnosis of AD with biomarker support, optimization of global recruitment, and avoiding inappropriate subgroup analyses can improve drug development success rates. Alzheimer disease (AD) doubles in frequency every 5 years after the age of 65 years and is becoming increasingly common as the world\\'s population ages. It is estimated that in the United States alone, the number of patients with AD will burgeon from 5.3 million now to nearly 14 million by 2050.1 To address this impending public health disaster, there is an urgent need to discover and develop new drugs to prevent, delay the onset, slow the progression, or treat the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of AD. AD drug development has proven to be unusually difficult with a 99.6% failure rate in the decade of 2002 to 20122; currently, the success rate continues at the same low level. Each clinical trial provides evidence on a narrow range of questions. For example, does this dose of the test agent, given for a specific period of time (e.g., 18–24 months for disease-modifying therapies [DMTs]), to a defined population (e.g., preclinical AD; prodromal AD; mild, moderate, or severe AD dementia) produce a statistically significant difference compared with placebo in change from baseline on the prespecified primary outcomes, such as those measuring cognition (e.g., the Alzheimer\\'s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Portion)3 and function (e.g., the Alzheimer\\'s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living scale).4 Questions regarding effects in other populations, other doses, other exposure durations, and effects on other instruments must all be addressed in separate trials. These complex constraints on clinical trials have evolved to allow them to define efficacy in a way that is acceptable to regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency. Regulatory acceptance of the data is the only way to gain marketing approval and make the agent widely available to patients. Each trial is a critical test of a narrow hypothesis and each incorporates methodologic decisions that offer valuable insights into AD drug development. It is important that learnings from every trial be optimized so the lessons learned can be applied to future trials and improve the likelihood of success. A review of the literature identifies several steps in drug development that have been the source of recurrent challenges to success. Perspectives on these lessons learned from past clinical trials are provided here with suggestions for how these lessons may be applied to future trials. Figure 1 shows how these lessons align with the phases of drug development. Animal models of AD are an important means of investigating efficacy and toxicity in the preclinical state prior to exposing humans to possibly toxic or inefficacious compounds. A commonly used animal model is a transgenic mouse with the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 double mutation. Triple and 5× transgenic models as well as many types of gene knock-in and gene knock-out models have been created to allow focused interrogation of the biology of AD.5 Many of the animal models address the amyloidogenic process leading to cortical plaques similar to those observed in human AD.6 These genetically engineered animals have abnormalities of amyloid metabolism but generally lack other aspects of human AD. Amyloid transgenic animals do not exhibit tau accumulation or cell death and have limited inflammatory changes.7 They have cognitive changes but do not develop severe progressive dementia equivalent to the human disease. Many types of therapy have been successful in reducing amyloid abnormalities in these animals and have often led to improved cognitive performance on tests, such as the Morris Water Maze or Novel Object Recognition.5 None of these successes at the preclinical level has predicted success at the human level. An important issue that has arisen with regard to animal models is their irreproducibility.8 If an experiment cannot be reproduced within a single model or across related models, then its ability to predict human outcomes is suspect. Strain, age, gender, diet, light, and handler behavior may all influence animal behavior. Randomization and sample size are important aspects of animal trial design that have often been suboptimal.9 Lack of rigor with regard to these aspects of animal model testing may contribute to the lack of reproducibility both across models and in translating results from animals to humans. The lesson to be derived from these observations is that animals serve as important gateways in the drug development process when the animal experiments are rigorously executed. These models reveal the impact of intervention on specific pathways, such as amyloid production or clearance. Advancing a drug to human testing that did not succeed as expected in animals would be unwise; as success in animals provides evidence about a specific aspect of the biology of AD and the relevant mechanism and efficacy of the proposed therapy. They do not provide evidence about the potential impact on the wider array of pathology characteristic of human AD and cannot be expected to predict the success of a candidate therapy in the human setting. The models are simulacra of specific aspects of human AD, such as amyloidosis, and cannot be taken as models of the full spectrum of pathology of human AD or predictors of human benefit.10 Use of induced pluripotent stem cells derived from humans with AD is a promising means of humanizing drug development much earlier in the process and possibly recapitulating more human-like circumstances for preclinical drug efficacy and safety assessments.11, 12 Small molecules intended to impact AD pathophysiology must cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This applies to all classes of agents (monoclonal antibodies [mAbs] are discussed below). In some cases, AD therapies have not been shown to enter the central nervous system (CNS) before advancing them to late-stage trials. In general, compounds must be small (<500 Daltons) to cross the BBB unless they are the subject of facilitated transport.13 Even if they are the appropriate size, they may be subject to transport out of the CNS, for example, by p-glycoprotein transport mechanisms.14 The compound-excluding mechanisms of the CNS differ in rodent models and in humans; thus, entry into the CNS in animal models does not adequately establish BBB penetration in humans.15 Tarenflurbil is an example of an AD treatment candidate that had effects on the animal model system of AD but likely did not cross the human BBB in sufficient amounts and failed in clinical trials.16 Nonhuman primate models provide better guidance for human BBB penetration but are not often used in development programs. The optimal means of demonstrating BBB penetration, establishing the plasma/brain ratio, and determining if CNS exposure is compatible with therapeutic effects as demonstrated preclinically, is to measure the level of the agent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF levels are a reasonable surrogate of brain levels since brain levels are inaccessible in human studies. Brain accumulation, brain clearance mechanisms, and intracellular entry are not completely resolved by CSF measures and remain a source of uncertainty.15 Monoclonal antibodies are large molecules that are excluded from the CNS except for very small numbers of the agent which cross the BBB. In most cases, 1 of 1,000 mAbs cross the BBB and enter the CNS.17 They may engage Aβ or tau directly or they may initiate inflammatory mechanisms in which activated microglia ingest the target and remove it from the CNS.17 An alternative view of mAb activity is that by binding peripheral Aβ, mAbs can create a \"peripheral sink\" that will create a peripheral/central imbalance and passively pull Aβ across the BBB into the periphery where it can be excreted and disposed.17 The peripheral sink hypothesis was assessed in recent trials of solanezumab, an mAb binding to peripheral Aβ. The agent led to markedly increased peripheral Aβ levels but did not meet prespecified clinical outcomes and did not change CSF Aβ(1–42) levels. These findings do not support a peripheral sink effect.18 The lesson of these observations is that, in small molecule drug development, CNS levels of the agent should be established in phase I. Proof-of-concept cannot be determined without establishing CNS penetration and plasma/CSF ratios. It is important to establish a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) whenever possible to insure that the highest possible doses have been explored. In some cases, occupancy studies may allow conclusions about dosing without an MTD if the receptor is fully occupied at lower doses. In other cases, solubility, volumes, or other limitations may cap the administered dose and the MTD cannot be determined. Beyond these exceptional circumstances an MTD should be determined. Without an MTD, failure to show a drug-placebo difference in phase II or phase III will raise the issue of an inadequate dose. Efficacy of a test agent is determined by the difference in change from baseline of the treatment compared with placebo. For symptomatic therapies tested in short trials (e.g., 3–6 months), there is typically improvement above baseline for the active agent compared with no change or mild decline below baseline in the placebo group.19 There is often a desire to use small sample sizes to minimize the cost of clinical trials. Small groups, however, can be affected by outliers and recruitment biases and can be misleading because of irregular outcomes in the placebo group. Unusual improvement in the placebo group undermines the ability to determine if the drug is efficacious, whereas an unusually rapid decline in the placebo group may be misleading in suggesting an overly robust benefit from the therapy. The latter outcome might lead investigators to under-power a subsequent trial expecting a similarly robust effect. To minimize the risk of irregular outcomes because of small numbers, the placebo group should include at least 100 members.20 The sample size for each active treatment group should be at least as large as the placebo arm of the study. This lesson applies primarily to phase II trials when go/no go decisions are formulated. Larger samples are necessary in phase III trials to confirm expected effects. AD is a progressive disease and failure to observe decline in the placebo group in trials of 6 months or more duration is indicative of a failed trial.21 For DMTs, efficacy is determined by less rapid decline in the group on active therapy; lack of placebo decline indicates that the hypothesized superior efficacy of the active treatment was not tested and no conclusion regarding efficacy can be drawn. Lack of decline may sometimes be attributed to inclusion of non-AD patients into the trial (see Lesson 7 below). The lesson suggested is that failure of decline in a placebo group indicates operational flaws and a failed trial. Donepezil has been shown to improve cognition in mild-moderate AD with a 1.5–2.5 Alzheimer\\'s Disease Assessment Scale – Cognitive Portion difference in drug vs. placebo change from baseline.22, 23 An active treatment arm with this agent can serve as a useful comparison group in trials. If no benefit is seen in the donepezil arm of the study compared with placebo, then the study has not achieved its operational goal and no conclusion can be drawn regarding the efficacy of the test agent.21, 24 The lesson derived is that an active comparator arm can provide insight into the quality of a clinical trial and failure to improve with an active comparator suggests operational shortcomings in the trial. If inclusion of an active comparator requires a true placebo arm in the trial, then implementation of an active comparator arm may not be feasible; nearly all current trials allow standard of care with approved agents. Studies of amyloid imaging in patients recruited to clinical trials show that up to 50% of mild cognitive impairment and 25% of those with mild dementia do not have a measurable amyloid plaque burden and do not meet biomarker criteria for AD.25 Subjects without AD typically show little or no change over time26 and, when included in AD trials, will be reflected in less decline of the placebo group and greater difficulty establishing a drug-placebo difference. The apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 gene is present in 65% of patients with AD27; therefore, trial populations with substantially lower representations of apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 carriers can be assumed to have fewer patients with AD in the trial cohort. For anti-amyloid agents, the presence of brain amyloid is critical for demonstration of efficacy. For drugs targeting nonamyloid AD-related mechanisms, such as tau agents, the presence of brain amyloidosis is necessary to insure the accuracy of diagnosis. Agents producing cognitive enhancement may have mechanisms independent of AD-specific pathology (e.g., 5-HT6 antagonists) but accurate diagnosis will help insure that the placebo group demonstrates the expected natural history of AD. A lesson to be derived from these observations is that clinical diagnosis of AD is insufficient for inclusion of subjects in clinical trials. Confirming the diagnosis using amyloid imaging or CSF measures of amyloid and tau or phospho-tau is required to insure the presence of AD in trial participants.28 Rigorous demonstration of hypothesized pharmacological effects in early-stage trials will assist in successful drug development. Many drugs fail in phase III because of lack of efficacy29; in some cases, the engagement of the intended target in humans has not been demonstrated in phase II trials and the biological basis for the expected clinical response has not been established. Phase IIa proof-of-concept studies have two related aspects: target engagement and proof-of-pharmacology. Target engagement is a measure that shows that the intended target of the drug is engaged in the human setting. Receptor occupancy studies using positron emission tomography are often used to show target engagement of agents for which there is a specific receptor.30 Another example of target engagement is assessment of the effects of beta-site cleavage enzyme (BACE) inhibitors on CSF BACE activity.31 Proof-of-pharmacology can be demonstrated by showing downstream effects of successful target engagement. Gamma-secretase inhibitors or gamma-secretase modulators result in reduced ß-amyloid protein synthesis, which has been demonstrated using the stable isotope-label kinetic technique.32, 33 Gamma-secretase inhibitors/gamma-secretase modulators change the cleavage of the amyloid protein producing an increase in short amyloid fragments detectable in CSF and establishing a pharmacologic effect.33, 34 BACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease CSF amyloid following chronic treatment, supporting proof-of-pharmacology.35 Removal of ß-amyloid plaques from the brain can be regarded as a target engagement and proof-of-pharmacology outcome. Aducanumab is a mAb that showed a dose- and time-dependent reduction in amyloid plaques and a reduction in rate of cognitive decline on some (but not all) cognitive measures included in a phase I trial.36 Target engagement of this type is not sufficient to predict drug efficacy. Some immunotherapies (e.g., AN1792, bapineuzumab, and gantenerumab) have been shown to have target engagement and reduce plaque amyloid without producing a corresponding clinical benefit.37-39 Thus, engaging the target is necessary for treatment response but does not insure that cognitive benefit will ensue. This may reflect the fact that insoluble plaque amyloid is not the most toxic form of amyloid; soluble species are more neurotoxic and may not be reduced by all antibodies. Phase II trials in drug development should minimally establish target engagement and doses to be advanced to phase III. A robust phase II program would also show a clinical benefit. Large sample sizes are typically required to demonstrate significant clinical benefit and many sponsors have progressed to phase III without conducting phase II studies. Establishing proof-of-target engagement or proof-of-pharmacology is one means of derisking phase III even without demonstrating cognitive benefit in phase II. DMTs being advanced without evidence of target engagement lack a critical aspect of the foundation of drug development. Development programs with biomarkers have a greater success rate than those without.40 Progressing to phase III without phase II also limits the availability of safety information that may impact phase III.41 A challenge for AD drug development is that there are many mechanisms for which there are no biomarkers available to demonstrate target engagement or proof-of-pharmacology. It is critical that, as agents are advanced from screening in assays to animal models to human testing, biomarkers indicative of target engagement be developed in concert with the candidate therapy. Biomarkers developed during drug development programs may become companion biomarkers useful to practitioners when the agent is advanced to the market. The lesson derived from the existing studies is that demonstration of target engagement is a key means of derisking a development program and that proceeding to phase III without target engagement or proof-of-pharmacology places the program at high risk for a negative outcome. Dose-response relationships provide critical information for drug choices. Dose escalation studies in phase I and dose refinement studies in phase II should provide confidence in the dose(s) selected for phase III.42 Dosing approaches ideally establish a low dose that is ineffective, one or two mid-range doses that are effective, and a high dose that is not tolerated and not acceptable. Regulatory agencies expect that patients are given the lowest effective dose to insure that they are not being exposed to unnecessary side effects. Knowledge of the neurobiology of AD is incomplete. Moreover, AD biology is complex,43 and biomarkers provide limited windows into this complex and ill-understood disease. Although working models of the order of events in AD have been posited, none have been proven and none have guided successful DMT development. Agnostic approaches to biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-tau, neurodegeneration) can be used to acknowledge the exploratory nature of our biomarker documentation of drug effects.44 To support DMT as the outcome of a therapy, trial sponsors should collect amyloid-tau, neurodegeneration biomarker data as well as other emerging biomarkers and biomarkers specifically linked to the mechanism of the intervention to delineate a comprehensive view of the impact of treatment. Preclinical, clinical, and biomarker data can be synthesized to provide support for DMT. The FDA specifies how to qualify biomarkers in trials of putative DMTs recommended.45 A lesson learned is that dependence on single key biomarkers should be avoided and multiple biomarker outcomes collected. Clinical trials, especially those for DMTs, are large and often require more than 1,000 patients. Timely recruitment for such trials often necessitates inclusion of clinical trial sites from many global regions. The variations in language, culture, trial experience, standard of care, genetics, nutrition, and other aspects of AD create variability in the data that may compromise the ability to demonstrate a drug-placebo difference. Recent studies of global trials show that North American and Western European data are very similar with regard to baseline characteristics, placebo group behavior, outcome measures, and adverse event reporting. Substantial variations on these parameters were observed for other global regions.46, 47 The lesson to be derived from these studies is that sponsors should seek ways of minimizing variability in global trials to insure greater data homogeneity. Post hoc analyses of negative trials are often pursued to detect treatment-responsive subgroups that can be exploited in future trials. This approach entails substantial risk of being misled by spurious results. Subgroups are not subject to the same recruitment or randomization as the original group; the sample sizes of subgroups are often small leading to underpowered results; and the outcome measures are typically not optimized for a specific subgroup. Basing a phase III program on a subgroup analysis of a phase II trial with a negative outcome has usually resulted in a negative phase III trial. Examples of this include the negative phase III outcomes for tarenflurbil,48 bapineuzumab,49 solanezumab,50 and ELND005.50 A lesson from these experiences is to apply guidelines for how to reduce the likelihood of being misled by phase II subgroup analyses. Table 151,52 shows the principal recommendations for subgroup analysis. A hypothesis-generating subgroup observation can be tested by conducting a phase II trial for this subgroup. Successful AD drug development is an unmet need and more disciplined approaches to drug development will assist in reducing the current high rate of negative trials.53 The lessons learned from trials with negative outcomes can inform drug development. Better preclinical models of AD, better knowledge of BBB penetration, MTD, dose response, demonstration of target engagement, more accurate diagnosis using biomarkers, select use of regional populations in trials, adequate trial size, construction of trial populations that exhibit decline in the placebo group, improvement in an active comparator group, and avoidance of misleading subgroup analyses can all contribute to greater success in AD drug development. These improvements in trial conduct and interpretation must be matched by studying candidate therapies that have superior efficacy. This two-pronged approach to AD therapy development will result in delivering urgently needed drugs to the rapidly growing AD population.

Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing.

However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts.\"},\n",

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.'},\n",

Such blending can provide benefits over pursuing these lines of research independently; for example, more rapid translational gains, more effective implementation strategies, and more useful information for decision makers. This study proposes a \"hybrid effectiveness-implementation\" typology, describes a rationale for their use, outlines the design decisions that must be faced, and provides several real-world examples. Results: An effectiveness-implementation hybrid design is one that takes a dual focus a priori in assessing clinical effectiveness and implementation. We propose 3 hybrid types: (1) testing effects of a clinical intervention on relevant outcomes while observing and gathering information on implementation; (2) dual testing of clinical and implementation interventions/strategies; and (3) testing of an implementation strategy while observing and gathering information on the clinical intervention\\'s impact on relevant outcomes. Conclusions: The hybrid typology proposed herein must be considered a construct still in evolution. Although traditional clinical effectiveness and implementation trials are likely to remain the most common approach to moving a clinical intervention through from efficacy research to public health impact, judicious use of the proposed hybrid designs could speed the translation of research findings into routine practice.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'In 2008 the WPA General Assembly approved the Action Plan of the Association for the triennium of the Presidency of Professor Mario Maj. One of the items of the Plan is the production of guidelines on practical issues of interest to psychiatrists worldwide (1,2. The present document, providing guidance on lessons learned and mistakes to avoid in the implementation of community mental health care, is part of that project. In subsequent publications we shall describe in more detail the particular challenges and solutions identified in the various regions worldwide. Mental health problems are common, with over 25% of people worldwide developing one or more mental disorders at some point in their life 3. They make an important contribution to the global burden of disease, as measured by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). In 2004, neuropsychiatric disorders accounted for 13.1% of all DALYs worldwide, with unipolar depressive disorder alone contributing 4.3% towards total DALYs. In addition, 2.1% of total deaths worldwide were directly attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders. Suicide contributed a further 1.4% towards all deaths, with 86% of all suicides being committed in low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs) each year 4. A systematic review of psychological autopsy studies reported a median prevalence of mental disorder in suicide completers of 91% 5. Life expectancy is lower in people with mental health problems than in those without (in some countries dramatically so) also due to their higher levels of physical illnesses 6. Mental health problems, therefore, place a substantial burden on individuals and their families worldwide, both in terms of diminished quality of life and reduced life expectancy. The provision of high-quality mental health care is vital in reducing some of this burden 7. In this context, the aim of this report is to present guidance on the steps, obstacles and mistakes to be avoided in the implementation of community mental health care, and to make realistic and achievable recommendations for the development and implementation of community-oriented mental health care worldwide over the next ten years. It is intended that this guidance will be of practical use to psychiatrists and other mental health and public health practitioners at all levels, including policy makers, commissioners, funders, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), service users and carers. Although a global approach has been taken, the focus is mainly upon LAMICs, as this is where challenges are most pronounced. There are wide inconsistencies between, and even within, countries in how community-oriented care is defined and interpreted. Historically speaking, in the more economically developed countries, mental health service provision has been divided into three periods 8: • The rise of the asylum (from around 1880 to 1955), which was defined by the construction of large asylums that were far removed from the populations they served. • The decline of the asylum or \"deinstitutionalization\" (after around 1955), characterized by a rise in community-based mental health services that were closer to the populations they served. • The reform of mental health services according to an evidence-based approach, balancing and integrating elements of both community and hospital services 8–10. Within a \"balanced care model\", most services are provided in community settings close to the populations served, with hospital stays being reduced as far as possible, and usually located in acute wards in general hospitals 11. Differing priorities apply to low, medium and high resource settings: • In low-resource settings, the focus is on establishing and improving the capacity of primary health care facilities to deliver mental health care, with limited specialist back-up. Most mental health assessment and treatment occurs, if at all, in primary health care settings or in relation to traditional/religious healers. For example, in Ethiopia, most care is provided within the family/close community of neighbours and relatives: only 33% of people with persistent major depressive disorder reach either primary health care or traditional healers 12,13. • In medium-resource settings, in addition to primary care mental health services, an extra layer of general adult mental health services can be developed as resources allow, in five categories: outpatient/ambulatory clinics; community mental health teams; acute inpatient services; community-based residential care; and work, occupation and rehabilitation services. • In high-resource countries, in addition to the above-mentioned services, more specialized ones dedicated to specific patient groups and goals may be affordable in the same five categories described for medium-resource settings. These may include, for instance, specialized outpatient and ambulatory clinics, assertive community treatment teams, intensive case management, early intervention teams, crisis resolution teams, crisis housing, community residential care, acute day hospitals, day hospitals, non-medical day centres, recovery/employment/rehabilitation services. It is this balanced care model approach that has been taken here in considering community-oriented care. In low-resource settings, community-oriented care will be characterized by: • A focus on population and public health needs. • Case finding and detection in the community. • Locally accessible services (i.e., accessible in less than half a day). • Community participation and decision-making in the planning and provision of mental health care systems. • Self-help and service user empowerment for individuals and families. • Mutual assistance and/or peer support of service users. • Initial treatment by primary care and/or community staff. • Stepped care options for referral to specialist staff and/or hospital beds if necessary. • Back-up supervision and support from specialist mental health services. • Interfaces with NGOs (for instance in relation to rehabilitation). • Networks at each level, including between different services, the community, and traditional and/or religious healers. Community-oriented care, therefore, draws on a wide range of practitioners, providers, care and support systems (both professional and non-professional), though particular components may play a larger or lesser role in different settings depending on the local context and the available resources, especially trained staff. Underpinning the successful implementation of community-oriented mental health care is a set of principles that relate on the one hand to the value of community and on the other to the importance of self-determination and the rights of people with mental illness as persons and citizens 14,15. Community mental health services emphasize the importance of treating and enabling people to live in the community in a way that maintains their connection with their families, friends, work and community. In this process it acknowledges and supports the person\\'s goals and strengths to further his/her recovery in his/her own community 16. A fundamental principle supporting these values is the notion of people having equitable access to services in their own locality in the \"least restrictive environment\". While recognizing the fact that some people are significantly impaired by their illness, a community mental health service seeks to foster the service user\\'s self-determination and his/her participation in processes involving decisions related to his/her treatment. Given the importance of families in providing support and key relationships, their participation (with the permission of the service user) in the processes of assessment, treatment planning and follow-up is also a key value in a community model of service delivery. Various conventions identify and aim to protect the rights of service users as persons and citizens, including the recently ratified United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (UNCRPD) 17 and more specific charters such as the UN Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and for the Improvement of Mental Care adopted in 1991 18. The above-mentioned and other international, regional and national documents specify the right of the person to be treated without discrimination and on the same basis as other persons; the presumption of legal capacity unless incapacity can be clearly proven; and the need to involve persons with disabilities in policy and service development and in decision-making which directly affects them 18. This report has been written to explicitly align with the requirements of the UNCRPD and associated treaties and conventions. This guidance has been produced by taking into account the key ethical principles, the relevant evidence, and the combined experience of the authors and their collaborators. In relation to the available evidence, systematic literature searches were undertaken to identify peer-reviewed and grey literature concerning the structure, functioning and effectiveness of community mental health services or obstacles to their implementation. These literature searches were organized for most of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regions, reflecting the context of the report\\'s main authors. There are limitations to this approach, in particular the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region was not fully represented, and this report focuses upon adult mental health services. Accordingly, this guidance does not address the service needs of people with dementia or intellectual impairment, and of children with mental disorders. Searches varied according to local expertise and resources. Medline was searched for every region. Other databases searched were EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, SciELO, Web of Knowledge (ISI), WorldCat Dissertations and Theses (OCLC) and OpenSigle. Searches, adapted for each database, were for M.E.S.H. terms and text words relating to community mental health services and severe mental illness. Other electronic, non-indexed sources, such as the WHO, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WPA, other mental health associations, and country-specific Ministry of Health websites, were also searched. Google was searched for PDFs published in European and African countries which contained the words \"community mental health\". Searches were limited to articles published in the languages spoken by the authors covering each WHO Region, and authors sought relevant advice from WHO Regional Advisors. Electronic searches were supplemented by searches of the reference lists of all selected articles. Hand searches of issues from the past five years of three key journals relevant to Africa (African Journal of Psychiatry, South African Journal of Psychiatry, and International Psychiatry) were also conducted. In addition, key texts were identified: these included relevant papers and book chapters published by authors of the current work 19–24 and a special edition of the Lancet on Global Mental Health 25–29. WHO publications which provide information regarding community mental health services worldwide were also sourced 7,31–33. For the Africa Region, original research was conducted in order to supplement published data. Twenty-one regional experts completed a semi-structured, self-report questionnaire concerning their experience in implementing community mental health care in sub-Saharan Africa 34. The experts were from 11 countries and one NGO active in several countries across sub-Saharan Africa. International and inter-cultural differences can play a significant role in shaping what mental health services are needed and possible within local settings (most particularly, the level of financial resources available 28). Nevertheless, in preparing this report, we have been surprised to find that the most fundamentally important themes (both in terms of challenges and lessons learned) apply to many countries and regions. We therefore discuss next each of these key themes in turn. One challenge common to many countries worldwide is the difficulty in putting community mental health intentions into practice. We distinguish here between: • National policy (or provincial or state policy in countries where health policy is set at that level): an overall statement of strategic intent (e.g., over a 5–10 year period) that gives direction to the whole system of mental health care. • Implementation plan: an operational document setting out the specific steps needed to implement the national policy (e.g., what tasks are to be completed, by whom, by when, with which resources, and identifying the reporting lines, and the incentives and sanctions if tasks are completed or not completed). • Mental health programmes: specific plans either for a local area (e.g., a region or a district) or for a particular sector (e.g., primary care) that specify how one component of the overall care system should be developed. According to WHO\\'s Mental Health Atlas 31, 62.1% of countries worldwide had a mental health policy, and 69.6% had a mental health programme in place in 2005 (with 68.3% and 90.9% of the global population covered respectively). Many of the countries without such policies were LAMICs. Even where comprehensive evidence-based mental health policies are in place, problems in implementing these policies are common 33,35). Some of the reasons may include health staff not complying with policies due to difficulties in accepting and implementing changing roles 33, the lack of accessible evidence-based information or guidelines for health staff, inadequate funding mechanisms, inadequate training of health care personnel, the lack of mechanisms for training and coaching health staff, poor supervision and support, and an overall lack of human resources 35. Detailed and highly practical implementation plans (taking into account available resources) are therefore necessary in enabling effective community mental health care provision. A further challenge that needs to be addressed worldwide is the massive gap between population needs for mental health care (true prevalence of mental illness) and what is actually provided in mental health care (treated prevalence) 7, highlighting the importance of scaling up services for whole populations. The evidence concerning the substantial burden of mental disorders has not been translated into adequate investments in mental health care 29. The treatment gap is particularly pronounced in LAMICs, where commonly over 75% of people with mental disorders receive no treatment or care at all, and less than 2% of the health budget is spent on mental health 7. Whilst the high-income countries of the world have an average of 10.50 psychiatrists and 32.95 psychiatric nurses per 100,000 population (median figures), in low-income countries there are only 0.05 and 0.16 respectively 31. Furthermore, even within countries, the quality and level of services often vary greatly according to, for instance, patient group, location (with service provision usually being higher in urban areas), or socio-economic factors 3. Similarly, only 10% of global mental health research is directed to the health needs of the 90% of population living in LAMICs, and only a fraction of this research activity is concerned with implementing and evaluating interventions and services (36). Methods to estimate resource needs are necessary in scaling up services. A systematic methodology for setting priorities in child health research has been developed taking into consideration that interventions should be effective, sustainable and affordable to reduce the burden of disease 37. A similar methodology was applied by the Lancet Global Mental Health Group, which focused on four groups of disorders whilst setting priorities for global mental health research: depressive, anxiety and other common mental disorders; alcohol- and other substance-abuse disorders; child and adolescent mental disorders; and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders 30. It was recommended that interventions should be delivered by non-mental health professionals within existing routine care settings, and specialists should play a role in capacity building and supervision 38. A comprehensive review of packages of care for six leading neuropsychiatric disorders − attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), alcohol abuse, dementia, depression, epilepsy and schizophrenia − have also recently been proposed as means to extend treatment in LAMICs 20–24. An extensive set of treatment guidelines, also suitable for LAMICs, will be published by the WHO in 2010 as a part of their mhGAP programme. A survey of availability and feasibility of various treatments for the most prevalent mental disorders in the various age groups has been recently carried out by the WPA with its Member Societies 39. A further common barrier in identifying and treating mental disorders worldwide is the lack of awareness about them within communities, with stigma towards, and discrimination against, people with mental health problems being widespread. This is important, because effective awareness-raising campaigns can result in increased presentation of persons with mental illness to primary health care 40. Three main strategies have been used to reduce public stigma and discrimination: protest, education, and social contact 41. Protest, by stigmatized individuals or members of the public who support them, is often applied against stigmatizing public statements, such as media reports and advertisements. Many protest interventions, for instance against stigmatizing advertisements or soap operas, have successfully suppressed negative public statements and for this purpose they are clearly very useful 42. However, it has been argued 41 that protest is not effective for improving attitudes toward people with mental illness. Education interventions aim to diminish stigma by replacing myths and negative stereotypes with facts, and have reduced stigmatizing attitudes among members of the public. However, research on educational campaigns suggests that behaviour changes are often not evaluated. The third strategy is personal social contact with persons with mental illness 43. For example, in a number of interventions in secondary schools, or with the police, education and personal social contact have been combined 44,45). Social contact appears to be the more efficacious part of the intervention. Factors that create an advantageous environment for interpersonal contact and stigma reduction may include equal status among participants, a cooperative interaction, and institutional support for the contact initiative 46. For both education and contact, the content of programmes against stigma and discrimination matters. Biogenetic models of mental illness are often highlighted because viewing mental illness as a biological, mainly inherited, problem may reduce shame and blame associated with it. Evidence supports this optimistic expectation (i.e., that a biogenetic causal model of mental illness will reduce stigma) in terms of reduced blame. However, focusing on biogenetic factors may increase the perception that people with mental illness are fundamentally different, and thus biogenetic interpretations have been associated with increased social distance 47. Therefore, a message of mental illness as being \"genetic\" or \"neurological\" may be overly simplistic and unhelpful for reducing stigma. Indeed, in many LAMICs, conveying a message emphasizing the heritable nature of mental illness fuels stigma, for instance making marriage more difficult. Anti-stigma initiatives can take place nationally as well as locally. National campaigns often adopt a social marketing approach, whereas local initiatives usually focus on target groups. An example of a large multifaceted national campaign is Time to Change in England 48. It combines mass-media advertising and local initiatives. The latter try to facilitate social contact between members of the general public and mental health service users as well as target specific groups such as medical students and teachers. The programme is evaluated by public surveys assessing knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, and by measuring the amount of experienced discrimination reported by people with mental illness. Similar initiatives in other countries, such as See Me in Scotland 49, Like Minds, Like Mine in New Zealand 50, or the WPA anti-stigma initiative 51, along with similar programmes in other countries, including Japan, Brazil, Egypt and Nigeria, have reported positive outcomes 40. In sum, there is evidence for the effectiveness of measures against stigma and against discrimination 52. On a more cautious note, individual discrimination, structural discrimination and self-stigma lead to innumerable mechanisms of stigmatization. If one mechanism of discrimination is blocked or diminished through successful initiatives, other ways to discriminate may emerge 53,54. Therefore, to substantially reduce discrimination, stigmatizing attitudes and behaviours of influential stakeholders need to change fundamentally. The collaborative engagement of a wide variety of supportive stakeholders is critical to successful implementation of community-oriented mental health care. It is important to have a systemic view of the change process. The support is needed of politicians, board members and health managers whose primary focus may not be on mental health, clinicians, key members of the community including NGO providers, service users and their families, and traditional and religious healers. To involve them in the imperative for change will require different strategies and a change management team that includes people with a variety of expertise. Overall, having clear reasons and objectives for the shift to community-oriented care is essential. Messages should be concise, backed by evidence and consistent. Developing consensus for change requires a lot of work in meeting and communicating with people. The main means of communication need to include written material and opportunities to meet with stakeholder groups. Politicians and administrators will require a compelling business case. However, others will need summaries of plans, slide presentations and the opportunity to meet and work through proposals and concerns. E-mails and website information and surveys are now valuable supplements to the process. The emphasis must be on a willingness to communicate in good faith and to do so openly and honestly doing \"what it takes\" to convince people of the benefits of the change process. It is important to bear in mind that in some cases prejudice and self-interest will have to be confronted. It is helpful, at the beginning of the process, to identify both those who are likely to support change, and those who are likely to oppose it. A willingness to listen to concerns and to find ways of incorporating them, if possible, into the planning and implementation process is essential because, when such an attitude is communicated, there is an opportunity for people to feel included in the process. That done, boldness and firmness will communicate to remaining detractors the seriousness of the intent to implement change; it will also encourage supporters to believe that their aspirations for better mental health care will be realized, and thus embolden them in turn. Engaging stakeholders requires both formal and informal opportunities to meet, receive advice and work through issues. The establishment of reference groups early on in the change process is a key formal mechanism to achieving this. These should include all the key stakeholders, in particular service users, families, clinicians and service providers, with the latter being essential to facilitate integrated systems of care further on in the process. While it is important to structure the overall process with formal meetings and communications, it is also important to be willing to convene informal meetings upon request to \"trouble-shoot\" situations of concern. The consultation process should result in an amalgam of \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" contributions to the change process. Reports on progress are an essential way of maintaining trust and building excitement to the process of successful implementation. It is also important to bear in mind that good mental health services have established processes for ensuring that the voices of service users, their families and community providers are heard on an ongoing basis. The aim is not simply to achieve discontinuous change, but to promote an ongoing quality improvement in which consumers of mental health services know they have a major stake. Without such effective and united consortia, policy makers may find it easy to disregard the different demands of a fragmented mental health sector, and instead respond positively to health domains (e.g., HIV/AIDS) which demonstrate the self-discipline of united approach with a small number of fully agreed priorities. Several key mistakes are commonly made in the process of attempting to implement community mental health care. First, there needs to be a carefully considered sequence of events linking hospital bed closure to community service development. It is important to avoid closing hospital-based services without having successor services already in place to support discharged patients and new referrals, and also to avoid trying to build up community services while leaving hospital care (and budgets) intact. In particular, there needs to be at each stage of a reform process a workable balance between enough (mainly acute) beds and the provision of other parts of the wider system of care that can support people in crisis. A second common mistake is to attempt system reform without including all the relevant stakeholders. Such initiatives especially need to include psychiatrists, who may otherwise feel subject to \"top-down\" decision making and react, either in the interests of patients or in their own interests, by attempting to delay or block any such changes. Other vital stakeholders to be directly included in the process will often include policy makers and politicians, health service planners, service users and carers, service providers including those in state and private practice, national and international NGOs, and those working in alternative, complementary, indigenous and religious healing traditions, and relevant national and professional associations. Typically, those groups not fully involved in a reform process will make their views known by seeking to undermine the process. A further common mistake is linking inappropriately the reform of mental health care with narrow ideological or party political interests. This tends to lead to instability, as a change of government may reverse the policies of their predecessors. Such fault lines of division or fragmentation may also occur, for example, between service reforms proposed by psychologists and psychiatrists, or between socially and biologically oriented psychiatrists, or between clinicians and service user/consumer groups. Whatever the particular points of schism, such conflicts weaken the chance that service reforms will be comprehensive, systemic and sustainable, and they also run the risk that policy makers will refuse to adopt proposals that are not fully endorsed by the whole mental health sector. Additional issues that may compromize the integrity of community based services include: a) an exclusive focus of community services on psychotic conditions, so that the vast majority of people with mental disorders are neglected or dealt with by professionals who do not have the appropriate expertise; and b) the neglect of patients\\' physical health. A fundamental component in the successful implementation of mental health service provision is that of funding 10. As indicated above, funding for mental health services in LAMICs tends to be very low. This may be due in part to a stigmatizing attitude toward mental disorders, and to an absence of the recognition of the economic benefits that can accrue from improved mental health care. Ideally, the share of its health funding that a country devotes to mental health care will be informed by careful consideration of the comparative health benefits of spending on alternative forms of care. The data needed to carry out such an analysis are, however, typically not available in LAMICs. Furthermore, whatever funding there is also tends to be concentrated on inpatient services. Correcting this is, initially, a matter of budgetary re-allocation: using resources that could have been used for other purposes to increase funding for community-oriented care. The issue then arises of how to pay public providers (hospitals, stand-alone programs, and possibly independent individual providers such as psychiatrists) for the services that they render. The simplest forms of payment are global budgets for facilities and programs, which may be carried over from year to year with minor adjustments for inflation, and salaries for individual providers. These simple payment mechanisms have the advantage of administrative simplicity. At the same time, they have at least two important drawbacks. First, they provide no incentive for increasing either the quantity or the quality of service provision. Second, population shifts are likely to cause the demand for the services of different providers to evolve and, without taking changes in local demand into account, inequities in payment across providers are likely to emerge and grow over time. This in turn will compromize access to overburdened providers, while possibly resulting in overprovision (e.g., excessive lengths of stay) by other providers. Accordingly, countries with the technical and administrative capacity to introduce more complex payment systems should consider doing so. For hospitals, a fairly simple alternative which'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Identifying, developing, and testing implementation strategies are important goals of implementation science. However, these efforts have been complicated by the use of inconsistent language and inadequate descriptions of implementation strategies in the literature. The Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study aimed to refine a published compilation of implementation strategy terms and definitions by systematically gathering input from a wide range of stakeholders with expertise in implementation science and clinical practice.Purposive sampling was used to recruit a panel of experts in implementation and clinical practice who engaged in three rounds of a modified Delphi process to generate consensus on implementation strategies and definitions. The first and second rounds involved Web-based surveys soliciting comments on implementation strategy terms and definitions. After each round, iterative refinements were made based upon participant feedback. The third round involved a live polling and consensus process via a Web-based platform and conference call.Participants identified substantial concerns with 31% of the terms and/or definitions and suggested five additional strategies. Seventy-five percent of definitions from the originally published compilation of strategies were retained after voting. Ultimately, the expert panel reached consensus on a final compilation of 73 implementation strategies.This research advances the field by improving the conceptual clarity, relevance, and comprehensiveness of implementation strategies that can be used in isolation or combination in implementation research and practice. Future phases of ERIC will focus on developing conceptually distinct categories of strategies as well as ratings for each strategy's importance and feasibility. Next, the expert panel will recommend multifaceted strategies for hypothetical yet real-world scenarios that vary by sites' endorsement of evidence-based programs and practices and the strength of contextual supports that surround the effort.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Major depressive disorder is one of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available; however, because of inadequate resources, antidepressants are used more frequently than psychological interventions. Prescription of these agents should be informed by the best available evidence. Therefore, we aimed to update and expand our previous work to compare and rank antidepressants for the acute treatment of adults with unipolar major depressive disorder.We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO, the websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers for published and unpublished, double-blind, randomised controlled trials from their inception to Jan 8, 2016. We included placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 21 antidepressants used for the acute treatment of adults (≥18 years old and of both sexes) with major depressive disorder diagnosed according to standard operationalised criteria. We excluded quasi-randomised trials and trials that were incomplete or included 20% or more of participants with bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, or treatment-resistant depression; or patients with a serious concomitant medical illness. We extracted data following a predefined hierarchy. In network meta-analysis, we used group-level data. We assessed the studies' risk of bias in accordance to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Primary outcomes were efficacy (response rate) and acceptability (treatment discontinuations due to any cause). We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) using pairwise and network meta-analysis with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42012002291.We identified 28 552 citations and of these included 522 trials comprising 116 477 participants. In terms of efficacy, all antidepressants were more effective than placebo, with ORs ranging between 2·13 (95% credible interval [CrI] 1·89-2·41) for amitriptyline and 1·37 (1·16-1·63) for reboxetine. For acceptability, only agomelatine (OR 0·84, 95% CrI 0·72-0·97) and fluoxetine (0·88, 0·80-0·96) were associated with fewer dropouts than placebo, whereas clomipramine was worse than placebo (1·30, 1·01-1·68). When all trials were considered, differences in ORs between antidepressants ranged from 1·15 to 1·55 for efficacy and from 0·64 to 0·83 for acceptability, with wide CrIs on most of the comparative analyses. In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs 1·19-1·96), whereas fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, and trazodone were the least efficacious drugs (0·51-0·84). For acceptability, agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine were more tolerable than other antidepressants (range of ORs 0·43-0·77), whereas amitriptyline, clomipramine, duloxetine, fluvoxamine, reboxetine, trazodone, and venlafaxine had the highest dropout rates (1·30-2·32). 46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low.All antidepressants were more efficacious than placebo in adults with major depressive disorder. Smaller differences between active drugs were found when placebo-controlled trials were included in the analysis, whereas there was more variability in efficacy and acceptability in head-to-head trials. These results should serve evidence-based practice and inform patients, physicians, guideline developers, and policy makers on the relative merits of the different antidepressants.National Institute for Health Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\"},\n",

Prosumption involves both production and consumption rather than focusing on either one (production) or the other (consumption). It is maintained that earlier forms of capitalism (producer and consumer capitalism) were themselves characterized by prosumption. Given the recent explosion of user-generated content online, we have reason to see prosumption as increasingly central. In prosumer capitalism, control and exploitation take on a different character than in the other forms of capitalism: there is a trend toward unpaid rather than paid labor and toward offering products at no cost, and the system is marked by a new abundance where scarcity once predominated. These trends suggest the possibility of a new, prosumer, capitalism.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and \"meta…\" rebranding from current reality is difficult, as \"big tech\" paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Evaluative texts on the Web have become a valuable source of opinions on products, services, events, individuals, etc. Recently, many researchers have studied such opinion sources as product reviews, forum posts, and blogs. However, existing research has been focused on classification and summarization of opinions using natural language processing and data mining techniques. An important issue that has been neglected so far is opinion spam or trustworthiness of online opinions. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of product reviews, which are opinion rich and are widely used by consumers and product manufacturers. In the past two years, several startup companies also appeared which aggregate opinions from product reviews. It is thus high time to study spam in reviews. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no published study on this topic, although Web spam and email spam have been investigated extensively. We will see that opinion spam is quite different from Web spam and email spam, and thus requires different detection techniques. Based on the analysis of 5.8 million reviews and 2.14 million reviewers from amazon.com, we show that opinion spam in reviews is widespread. This paper analyzes such spam activities and presents some novel techniques to detect them'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Purpose Knowledge sharing is the corner‐stone of many organisations’ knowledge‐management (KM) strategy. Despite the growing significance of knowledge sharing's practices for organisations’ competitiveness and market performance, several barriers make it difficult for KM to achieve the goals and deliver a positive return on investment. This paper provides a detailed review of current KM and related literatures on a large number of possible knowledge‐sharing barriers with the purpose of offering a more comprehensive and structured starting‐point for senior managers when auditing their organisation's current knowledge base and knowledge‐sharing requirements. Design/methodology/approach This article reviews and discusses over three dozen potential knowledge‐sharing barriers, categorising them into three main domains of recently published works: individual/personal, organisational, and technological barriers. Findings The extensive list of knowledge sharing barriers provides a helpful starting point and guideline for senior managers auditing their existing practices with a view to identifying any bottle‐necks and improving on the overall effectiveness of knowledge‐sharing activities. Practical implications Managers need to realise, however, that a particular knowledge sharing strategy or specific managerial actions will not suit all companies and that there are differences to be expected between MNCs and SMEs, private, public sector, and not‐for‐profit organisations. As such, the implementation of knowledge‐sharing goals and strategies into an organisation's strategic planning and thinking will vary greatly. Originality/value The main discussion of this paper brings together a large range of knowledge‐ sharing barriers in an attempt to indicate the complexity of knowledge sharing as a value‐creating organisational activity.\"},\n",

Building from not only extant research but also extensive interactions with practice, the authors propose a multidimensional framework for understanding the impact of AI involving intelligence levels, task types, and whether AI is embedded in a robot. Prior research typically addresses a subset of these dimensions; this paper integrates all three into a single framework. Next, the authors propose a research agenda that addresses not only how marketing strategies and customer behaviors will change in the future, but also highlights important policy questions relating to privacy, bias and ethics. Finally, the authors suggest AI will be more effective if it augments (rather than replaces) human managers.'},\n",

The study found that neural-network models such as feedforward and feedback propagation artificial neural networks are performing better in its application to human problems. Therefore, we proposed feedforward and feedback propagation ANN models for research focus based on data analysis factors like accuracy, processing speed, latency, fault tolerance, volume, scalability, convergence, and performance. Moreover, we recommend that instead of applying a single method, future research can focus on combining ANN models into one network-wide application.'},\n",

This framework lays out the ways that AI can be used for marketing research, strategy (segmentation, targeting, and positioning, STP), and actions. At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization. We apply this framework to various areas of marketing, organized by marketing 4Ps/4Cs, to illustrate the strategic use of AI.'},\n",

This research describes snowball sampling as a purposeful method of data collection in qualitative research. Methods This paper is a descriptive review of previous research papers. Data were gathered using English keywords, including \"review,\" \"declaration,\" \"snowball,\" and \"chain referral,\" as well as Persian keywords that are equivalents of the following: \"purposeful sampling,\" \"snowball,\" \"qualitative research,\" and \"descriptive review.\" The databases included Google Scholar, Scopus, Irandoc, ProQuest, Science Direct, SID, MagIran, Medline, and Cochrane. The search was limited to Persian and English articles written between 2005 and 2013. Results The preliminary search yielded 433 articles from PubMed, 88 articles from Scopus, 1 article from SID, and 18 articles from MagIran. Among 125 articles, methodological and non-research articles were omitted. Finally, 11 relevant articles, which met the criteria, were selected for review. Conclusions Different methods of snowball sampling can be applied to facilitate scientific research, provide community-based data, and hold health educational programs. Snowball sampling can be effectively used to analyze vulnerable groups or individuals under special care. In fact, it allows researchers to access susceptible populations. Thus, it is suggested to consider snowball sampling strategies while working with the attendees of educational programs or samples of research studies.'},\n",

To understand the user's social sharing and social shopping intention in social networking Web sites, we conducted an empirical study on a popular microblog to investigate how social factors such as social support and relationship quality affect the user's intention of future participation in social commerce. The results indicate that both factors play a critical role. Social support and Web site quality positively influence the user's intention to use social commerce and to continue using a social networking site. These effects are found to be mediated by the quality of the relationship between the user and the social networking Web site.

To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model\\'s predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial \"machine learning as a service\" providers such as Google and Amazon.

User generated content encourages inquiry and decision-making. Given the relevance of social media to various stakeholders, it has received significant attention from researchers of various fields, including information systems. There exists no comprehensive review that integrates and synthesises the findings of literature on social media. This study discusses the findings of 132 papers (in selected IS journals) on social media and social networking published between 1997 and 2017. Most papers reviewed here examine the behavioural side of social media, investigate the aspect of reviews and recommendations, and study its integration for organizational purposes. Furthermore, many studies have investigated the viability of online communities/social media as a marketing medium, while others have explored various aspects of social media, including the risks associated with its use, the value that it creates, and the negative stigma attached to it within workplaces. The use of social media for information sharing during critical events as well as for seeking and/or rendering help has also been investigated in prior research. Other contexts include political and public administration, and the comparison between traditional and social media. Overall, our study identifies multiple emergent themes in the existing corpus, thereby furthering our understanding of advances in social media research. The integrated view of the extant literature that our study presents can help avoid duplication by future researchers, whilst offering fruitful lines of enquiry to help shape research for this emerging field.'},\n",

Evidence of the instrument's discriminant validity is presented. Reliability and validity is assessed by nature and type of application. Finally, standards for evaluating end-user applications are presented, and the instrument's usefulness for achieving more precision in research questions is explored.\"},\n",

A systematic review with narrative synthesis was conducted. Searches of electronic databases Medline, PsychInfo, EMBASE, Social Science Index via Web of Knowledge and CINHAL were conducted for English language articles published up to May 2013. Qualitative and quantitative studies as well as literature reviews were included. Articles were included if they reported attempts to increase disadvantaged group participation in research, or the barriers to research with disadvantaged groups. Groups of interest were those described as socially, culturally or financially disadvantaged compared to the majority of society. Eligible articles were categorised according to five phases of research: 1) sampling, 2) recruitment and gaining consent, 3) data collection and measurement, 4) intervention delivery and uptake, and 5) retention and attrition. In total, 116 papers from 115 studies met inclusion criteria and 31 previous literature reviews were included. A comprehensive summation of the major barriers to working with various disadvantaged groups is provided, along with proposed strategies for addressing each of the identified types of barriers. Most studies of strategies to address the barriers were of a descriptive nature and only nine studies reported the results of randomised trials. To tackle the challenges of research with socially disadvantaged groups, and increase their representation in health and medical research, researchers and research institutions need to acknowledge extended timeframes, plan for higher resourcing costs and operate via community partnerships.'},\n",

Scholars have been pondering WOM over 2400 years, although modern marketing research into WOM started only relatively recently, in the post-war 1940s. WOM can be characterized by valence, focus, timing, solicitation and degree of management intervention. Most recent WOM research has been conducted from a customer-to-customer perspective, even though WOM is found in other contexts such as influence, employee and recruitment markets. Marketing research into WOM has attempted to answer two questions. What are the antecedents of WOM? What are the consequences of WOM?

This paper reports results of a study that measured consumer satisfaction with the EC channel through constructs prescribed by three established frameworks, namely the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA), and Service Quality (SERVQUAL). Subjects purchased similar products through conventional as well as EC channels and reported their experiences in a survey after each transaction. Using constructs from the three frameworks, a model was constructed and tested to examine the determinants of the EC channel satisfaction and preference using the survey data. Structural equation model analyses indicate that metrics tested through each model provide a statistically significant explanation of the variation in the EC consumers' satisfaction and channel preference. The study found that TAM components—perceived ease of use and usefulness—are important in forming consumer attitudes and satisfaction with the EC channel. Ease of use also was found to be a signi.cant determinant of satisfaction in TCA. The study found empirical support for the assurance dimension of SERVQUAL as determinant in EC channel satisfaction. Further, the study also found general support for consumer satisfaction as a determinant of channel preference.\"},\n",

Unsurprisingly, we find that the largest cascades tend to be generated by users who have been influential in the past and who have a large number of followers. We also find that URLs that were rated more interesting and/or elicited more positive feelings by workers on Mechanical Turk were more likely to spread. In spite of these intuitive results, however, we find that predictions of which particular user or URL will generate large cascades are relatively unreliable. We conclude, therefore, that word-of-mouth diffusion can only be harnessed reliably by targeting large numbers of potential influencers, thereby capturing average effects. Finally, we consider a family of hypothetical marketing strategies, defined by the relative cost of identifying versus compensating potential \"influencers.\" We find that although under some circumstances, the most influential users are also the most cost-effective, under a wide range of plausible assumptions the most cost-effective performance can be realized using \"ordinary influencers\"---individuals who exert average or even less-than-average influence.'},\n",

Automation does indeed substitute for labor—as it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a “polarization” of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization and is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.'},\n",

We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion‐annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.'},\n",

The findings indicate that perceived ease of use is a dominant factor in explaining perceived usefulness and system usage, and that perceived usefulness has a strong effect on system usage. The results also indicate that exogenous variables influence both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, particularly management support and external support.

The theory suggests that a supplier and a customer can improve their joint learning activities by facilitating information exchange, developing common learning arenas, and updating their behavior accordingly. The authors suggest that learning within a customer–supplier relationship cannot be mandated by either organization, but rather learning depends on both parties’ willingness to cooperate in joint learning activities. Management can promote relationship learning by cultivating a collaborative culture, formulating specific objectives for joint learning activities, and developing relational trust. However, as relational trust develops, the effectiveness of learning is reduced as a result of “hidden costs” of trust. The authors use data from 315 dyads to test the theory empirically, and they find that the learning capability of a relationship has a strong, positive effect on performance. Their results also provide insight into how to address the hidden costs of trust.'},\n",

Design/methodology/approach The study performs a systematic and content-centric review of literature based on a six-stage approach to identify key design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0. The study further benefits from a comprehensive content analysis of the 178 documents identified, both manually and via IBM Watson’s natural language processing for advanced text analysis. Findings Industry 4.0 is an integrative system of value creation that is comprised of 12 design principles and 14 technology trends. Industry 4.0 is no longer a hype and manufacturers need to get on board sooner rather than later. Research limitations/implications The strategic roadmap presented in this study can serve academicians and practitioners as a stepping stone for development of a detailed strategic roadmap for successful transition from traditional manufacturing into the Industry 4.0. However, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy that suits all businesses or industries, meaning that the Industry 4.0 roadmap for each company is idiosyncratic, and should be devised based on company’s core competencies, motivations, capabilities, intent, goals, priorities and budgets. Practical implications The first step for transitioning into the Industry 4.0 is the development of a comprehensive strategic roadmap that carefully identifies and plans every single step a manufacturing company needs to take, as well as the timeline, and the costs and benefits associated with each step. The strategic roadmap presented in this study can offer as a holistic view of common steps that manufacturers need to undertake in their transition toward the Industry 4.0. Originality/value The study is among the first to identify, cluster and describe design principles and technology trends that are building blocks of the Industry 4.0. The strategic roadmap for Industry 4.0 transition presented in this study is expected to assist contemporary manufacturers to understand what implementing the Industry 4.0 really requires of them and what challenges they might face during the transition process.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Over the last few years, the fourth industrial revolution has attracted more and more attentions all around the world. In the current literature, there is still a lack of efforts to systematically review the state of the art of this new industrial revolution wave. The aim of this study is to address this gap by investigating the academic progresses in Industry 4.0. A systematic literature review was carried out to analyse the academic articles within the Industry 4.0 topic that were published online until the end of June 2016. In this paper, the obtained results from both the general data analysis of included papers (e.g. relevant journals, their subject areas and categories, conferences, keywords) and the specific data analysis corresponding to four research sub-questions are illustrated and discussed. These results not only summarise the current research activities (e.g. main research directions, applied standards, employed software and hardware), but also indicate existing deficiencies and potential research directions through proposing a research agenda. Findings of this review can be used as the basis for future research in Industry 4.0 and related topics.'},\n",

The authors conceptualize two components of fairness-distributive fairness, that is, the fairness of outcomes received by the reseller from carrying the supplier's line, and procedural fairness, the fairness of procedures and processes used by the supplier in relation to its resellers. Testing their hypotheses from the perspective of automobile dealers, the authors find strong evidence that vulnerable resellers' perceptions of both distributive and procedural fairness enhance their relationship quality, although these effects are moderated by the level of outcomes and environmental uncertainty. Furthermore, procedural fairness has relatively stronger effects on relationship quality than distributive fairness, which is a somewhat surprising result from a managerial perspective. The constructs and relationships among the constructs demonstrate cross-national stability across the two countries in the sample, the United States and the Netherlands.\"},\n",

Despite this growth, many public health professionals have an incomplete understanding of the field. To advance current knowledge, we provide a practical definition and discuss the conceptual underpinnings of social marketing. We then describe several case studies to illustrate social marketing's application in public health and discuss challenges that inhibit the effective and efficient use of social marketing in public health. Finally, we reflect on future developments in the field. Our aim is practical: to enhance public health professionals' knowledge of the key elements of social marketing and how social marketing may be used to plan public health interventions.\"},\n",

I would also like to thank Linda Pike for her tremendous help, as well as Robert I. Sutton and three anonymous reviewers. This study examines the structure of 105 work groups and management teams to address the question of whether conflict can be beneficial. Multiple methods were used to examine the effects of conflict on both individualand group-level variables to provide a more refined model of intragroup conflict. Results show that whether conflict was beneficial depended on the type of conflict and the structure of the group in terms of task type, task interdependence, and group norms. Relationship and task conflicts were negatively associated with individuals' satisfaction, liking of other group members, and intent to remain in the group. In groups performing very routine tasks, disagreements about the task were detrimental to group functioning. In contrast, in groups performing nonroutine tasks, disagreements about the tasks did not have a detrimental effect, and in some cases, such disagreements were actually beneficial. Contrary to expectations, norms encouraging open discussion of conflict were not always advantageous. The results suggest that while such norms were associated with an increase in the number and intensity of relationship conflicts, they did not increase members' ability to deal with the conflicts constructively. The model developed here contributes to an integrated perspective on organizational conflict.'\"},\n",

The performance metric that was developed includes the subconstructs user satisfaction, the likelihood of return, and the frequency of use. Data was collected in 1997, 1999, and 2000 from corporate Web sites via three methods, namely, a jury, third-party ratings, and a software agent. Significant associations between Web site design elements and Web site performance indicate that the constructs demonstrate good nomological validity. Together, the three studies provide a set of measures with acceptable validity and reliability. The findings also suggest lack of significant common methods biases across the jury-collected data, third-party data, and agent-collected data. Results suggest that Web site success is a first-order construct. Moreover, Web site success is significantly associated with Web site download delay (speed of access and display rate within the Web site), navigation (organization, arrangement, layout, and sequencing), content (amount and variety of product information), interactivity (customization and interactivity), and responsiveness (feedback options and FAQs).'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Heart failure is a life-threatening disease and addressing it should be considered a global health priority. At present, approximately 26 million people worldwide are living with heart failure. The outlook for such patients is poor, with survival rates worse than those for bowel, breast or prostate cancer. Furthermore, heart failure places great stresses on patients, caregivers and healthcare systems. Demands on healthcare services, in particular, are predicted to increase dramatically over the next decade as patient numbers rise owing to ageing populations, detrimental lifestyle changes and improved survival of those who go on to develop heart failure as the final stage of another disease. It is time to ease the strain on healthcare systems through clear policy initiatives that prioritize heart failure prevention and champion equity of care for all. Despite the burdens that heart failure imposes on society, awareness of the disease is poor. As a result, many premature deaths occur. This is in spite of the fact that most types of heart failure are preventable and that a healthy lifestyle can reduce risk. Even after heart failure has developed, premature deaths could be prevented if people were taught to recognize the symptoms and seek immediate medical attention. Public awareness campaigns focusing on these messages have great potential to improve outcomes for patients with heart failure and ultimately to save lives. Compliance with clinical practice guidelines is also associated with improved outcomes for patients with heart failure. However, in many countries, there is considerable variation in how closely physicians follow guideline recommendations. To promote equity of care, improvements should be encouraged through the use of hospital performance measures and incentives appropriate to the locality. To this end, policies should promote the research required to establish an evidence base for performance measures that reflect improved outcomes for patients. Continuing research is essential if we are to address unmet needs in caring for patients with heart failure. New therapies are required for patients with types of heart failure for which current treatments relieve symptoms but do not address the disease. More affordable therapies are desperately needed in the economically developing world. International collaborative research focusing on the causes and treatment of heart failure worldwide has the potential to benefit tens of millions of people. Change at the policy level has the power to drive improvements in prevention and care that will save lives. It is time to make a difference across the globe by confronting the problem of heart failure.POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS: We urge policymakers at local, national and international levels to collaborate and act on the following recommendations.Support the development and implementation of public awareness programmes about heart failure. These should define heart failure in simple and accessible language, explain how to recognize the symptoms and emphasize that most types of heart failure are preventable.Highlight the need for healthcare professionals across all clinical disciplines to identify patients with illnesses that increase the risk of heart failure and to prescribe preventive medications.Prioritize the elimination of infectious diseases in parts of the world where they still cause heart failure.Encourage the development and use of heart failure education programmes for all appropriate healthcare professionals. These should aim to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and long-term management of heart failure and raise awareness of clinical practice guidelines.Provide a healthcare system that delivers timely access to diagnostic services and treatment of heart failure, as well as a seamless transition to long-term management.Ensure that the best available and most appropriate care is consistently provided to all patients with heart failure through efficient use of resources.Provide resources for the education and practical support of patients with heart failure and their families or other caregivers, empowering them to engage proactively in long-term care.Fund and encourage international collaborative research to improve understanding of the patterns, causes and effects of modern day heart failure and how the disease can be prevented across the globe.Fund and encourage research into new and more affordable therapies and medical devices for all types of heart failure.Fund and encourage research into evidence-based healthcare performance measures that reflect improved clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure.'},\n",

Design/methodology/approach Case study of the web community “my Nutella The Community” promoted by the firm Ferrero in Italy. The study applied multiple methods and was conducted through interviews with key informants, netnography and document analysis. Findings The virtual community that gathers around a convenience product brand shows a new form of sociality and customer empowerment: it is not based on interaction between peers, but more on personal self‐exhibition in front of other consumers through the marks and rituals linked to the brand. The company should play the role of non‐intrusive enabler of these personal expressions, reducing its control over the brand's meanings. Originality/value The literature on brand community has traditionally focused on communities born around niche or luxury brand (Harley Davidson, Mercedes, Saab).

One method for creating value is to reduce costs in commercial exchange. The authors develop a model that explains how supplier behaviors and the management of suppliers affect a customer firm's direct product, acquisition, and operations costs. The model proposes that these costs mediate the relationship between buyer–supplier relationship behaviors and the customer firm's intentions to expand future purchases from the supplier. The model is tested on data collected from almost 500 buying organizations in the United States and Germany. The results indicate that increased communication frequency, different forms of supplier accommodation, product quality, and the geographic closeness of the supplier's facilities to the customer's buying location lower customer firm costs. In addition, customer firms intend to increase purchases from suppliers that provide value by lowering each of these costs.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Trust is a vital relationship concept that needs clarification because researchers across disciplines have defined it in so many different ways. A typology of trust types would make it easier to compare and communicate results, and would be especially valuable if the types of trust related to one other. The typology should be interdisciplinary because many disciplines research e-commerce. This paper justifies a parsimonious interdisciplinary typology and relates trust constructs to e-commerce consumer actions, defining both conceptual-level and operational-level trust constructs. Conceptual-level constructs consist of disposition to trust (primarily from psychology), institution-based trust (from sociology), and trusting beliefs and trusting intentions (primarily from social psychology). Each construct is decomposed into measurable subconstructs, and the typology shows how trust constructs relate to already existing Internet relationship constructs. The effects of Web vendor interventions on consumer behaviors are posited to be partially mediated by consumer trusting beliefs and trusting intentions in the e-vendor.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Purpose – This paper aims to delineate the meaning, conceptual boundaries and dimensions of consumer engagement within the context of online brand communities both in term of the engagement with the brand and the other members of the online brand communities. It also explores the relationships of consumer engagement with other concepts, suggesting antecedents of engagement. Design/methodology/approach – Data are collected through semi-structured interviews with 21 international online brand community members, covering a variety of brand categories and social media platforms. Findings – This paper suggests that individuals are engaging in online communities in social network platforms both with other individuals and with brands. The study also identifies three key engagement dimensions (cognition, affect and behaviours). Their meaning and sub-dimensions are investigated. The paper further suggests key drivers, one outcome and objects of consumer engagement in online brand communities. These findings are integrated in a conceptual framework. Research limitations/implications – Further research should aim at comparing consumer engagement on different social media and across brand categories, as this study takes a holistic approach and does not focus on any particular category of brands or social media. Consumers’ views should also be evaluated against and compared with marketing managers’ understanding of consumer engagement. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the fast-growing and fragmented consumer engagement literature by refining the understanding of its dimensions and situating it in a network of conceptual relationships. It focusses on online brand communities in rich social media contexts to tap into the core social and interactive characteristics of engagement.'},\n",

This paper describes and critiques organizational culture studies done in industrial settings, some of which were based on anthropological paradigms, including the structural-functional and configurationist holistic paradigms. Most failed to explore multiple native views. In this paper, a multicultural model is proposed for large organizations, and problems of cross-cultural contact are described. Native-view paradigms from anthropology, especially ethnoscience ethnography, are recommended for exploring multiple perspectives in detail. An illustration from a recent study of Silicon Valley technical professionals' native views is presented to demonstrate how ethnoscience methods, in particular, can be applied to the task of studying culture.\"},\n",

Communications systems operate through two pathways. In the direct pathway, they promote changes by informing, enabling, motivating, and guiding participants. In the socially mediated pathway, media influences link participants to social networks and community settings that provide natural incentives and continued personalized guidance, for desired change. Social cognitive theory analyzes social diffusion of new styles of behavior in terms of the psychosocial factors governing their acquisition and adoption and the social networks through which they spread and are supported. Structural interconnectedness provides potential diffusion paths; sociocognitive factors largely determine what diffuses through those paths.'},\n",

In many cases, some element of fear is incorporated within these communications. However, within the context of computer security and information assurance, it is not yet clear how these fear-inducing arguments, known as fear appeals, will ultimately impact the actions of end users. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of fear appeals on the compliance of end users with recommendations to enact specific individual computer security actions toward the mitigation of threats. An examination was performed that culminated in the development and testing of a conceptual model representing an infusion of technology adoption and fear appeal theories.\\r\\n\\r\\nResults of the study suggest that fear appeals do impact end user behavioral intentions to comply with recommended individual acts of security, but the impact is not uniform across all end users. It is determined in part by perceptions of self-efficacy, response efficacy, threat severity, and social influence. The findings of this research contribute to information systems security research, human-computer interaction, and organizational communication by revealing a new paradigm in which IT users form perceptions of the technology, not on the basis of performance gains, but on the basis of utility for threat mitigation.'},\n",

The proposed method accounts for not only preference heterogeneity across users but also unobserved product heterogeneity by introducing the interaction of unobserved product attributes with customer characteristics.

       "  'abstract': 'The PARiHS framework (Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services) has proved to be a useful practical and conceptual heuristic for many researchers and practitioners in framing their research or knowledge translation endeavours. However, as a conceptual framework it still remains untested and therefore its contribution to the overall development and testing of theory in the field of implementation science is largely unquantified. This being the case, the paper provides an integrated summary of our conceptual and theoretical thinking so far and introduces a typology (derived from social policy analysis) used to distinguish between the terms conceptual framework, theory and model – important definitional and conceptual issues in trying to refine theoretical and methodological approaches to knowledge translation. Secondly, the paper describes the next phase of our work, in particular concentrating on the conceptual thinking and mapping that has led to the generation of the hypothesis that the PARiHS framework is best utilised as a two-stage process: as a preliminary (diagnostic and evaluative) measure of the elements and sub-elements of evidence (E) and context (C), and then using the aggregated data from these measures to determine the most appropriate facilitation method. The exact nature of the intervention is thus determined by the specific actors in the specific context at a specific time and place. In the process of refining this next phase of our work, we have had to consider the wider issues around the use of theories to inform and shape our research activity; the ongoing challenges of developing robust and sensitive measures; facilitation as an intervention for getting research into practice; and finally to note how the current debates around evidence into practice are adopting wider notions that fit innovations more generally. The paper concludes by suggesting that the future direction of the work on the PARiHS framework is to develop a two-stage diagnostic and evaluative approach, where the intervention is shaped and moulded by the information gathered about the specific situation and from participating stakeholders. In order to expedite the generation of new evidence and testing of emerging theories, we suggest the formation of an international research implementation science collaborative that can systematically collect and analyse experiences of using and testing the PARiHS framework and similar conceptual and theoretical approaches. We also recommend further refinement of the definitions around conceptual framework, theory, and model, suggesting a wider discussion that embraces multiple epistemological and ontological perspectives.'},\n",

The objectives of the review were to: systematically collect, document, scrutinise and critically analyse the current research literature on supply‐side higher education marketing; establish the scope of higher education marketing; identify gaps in the research literature; and make recommendations for further research in this field. Design/methodology/approach The approach for this study entailed extensive searches of relevant business management and education databases. The intention was to ensure that, as far as possible, all literature in the field was identified – while keeping the focus on literature of greatest pertinence to the research questions . Findings The paper finds that potential benefits of applying marketing theories and concepts that have been effective in the business world are gradually being recognised by researchers in the field of HE marketing. However, the literature on HE marketing is incoherent, even inchoate, and lacks theoretical models that reflect upon the particular context of HE and the nature of their services. Research limitations/implications The research field of HE marketing is still at a relatively pioneer stage with much research still to be carried out both from a problem identification and strategic perspective. Originality/value Despite the substantial literature on the marketisation of HE and consumer behaviour, scholarship to provide evidence of the marketing strategies that have been implemented by HE institutions on the supply‐side remains limited, and this is relatively uncharted territory. This paper reviews the literature in the field, focusing on marketing strategies in the rapidly developing HE international market.'},\n",

Travelers are increasingly using ORs to inform them about accommodations and other tourism-related products. As such, it is important to improve our understanding of the behavioral consequences of e-word-of-mouth. In this article, we adopt the elaboration likelihood model to identify what influences travelers to adopt information from ORs in their decision making. We measure the influence of six dimensions of information quality that are part of the central route and two dimensions that are associated with the peripheral route of persuasion. The results of this study reveal that product ranking, information accuracy, information value-added, information relevance, and information timeliness are strong predictors of travelers’ adoption of information from ORs on accommodations. These results imply that high-involvement travelers adopt both central (information quality) and peripheral (product ranking) routes when they process information from ORs.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Antibiotic use plays a major role in the emerging public health crisis of antibiotic resistance. Although the majority of antibiotic use occurs in agricultural settings, relatively little attention has been paid to how antibiotic use in farm animals contributes to the overall problem of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this review is to summarize literature on the role of antibiotics in the development of resistance and its risk to human health. We searched multiple databases to identify major lines of argument supporting the role of agricultural antibiotic use in the development of resistance and to summarize existing regulatory and policy documents. Several lines of reasoning support the conclusion that agricultural antibiotics are associated with resistance, yet most public policy is based on expert opinion and consensus. Finally, we propose strategies to address current gaps in knowledge.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This article examines the role of monetary rewards in encouraging knowledge sharing in organizations through four mechanisms of knowledge sharing. We argue that the system of contributing knowledge to databases is the most amenable to rewards contingent on knowledge sharing behaviors because of opportunities for the reward allocator to measure the knowledge sharing behaviors. In the case of formal interactions within or across teams and work units, while rewards could be made partly contingent on knowledge sharing behaviors as in merit pay, rewards based on collective performance are also likely to be effective in creating a feeling of cooperation, ownership, and commitment among employees. In addition, we propose that team-based rewards and company wide incentives (profit sharing, gainsharing, and employee stock options) would be particularly instrumental in enhancing knowledge sharing within teams and across work units, respectively. In the case of knowledge sharing through informal interactions, the key enabling factor is trust between the individual and the organization. In this case, the role of rewards is indirect, that is, procedural and distributive fairness of organizational rewards are important factors in the development of trust. We also consider knowledge sharing in communities of practice and theorize that intrinsic rewards and factors that build expertise and provide recognition are the most appropriate means of fostering feeling of competence. Finally, we discuss the research implications.'},\n",

It also aims to reveal and test the close relationship between the trust in a web site and the degree of loyalty to it. Design/methodology/approach First, there is an explanation of the main attributes of the concepts examined, with special attention being paid to the multi‐dimensional nature of the variables and the relationships between them. This is followed by an examination of the validation processes of the measuring instruments. Findings Specifically, the study reveals that an individual's loyalty to a web site is closely linked to the levels of trust. Thus, the development of trust not only affects the intention to buy, as shown by previous researchers, but it also directly affects the effective purchasing behavior, in terms of preference, cost and frequency of visits, and therefore, the level of profitability provided by each consumer. In addition, the analyses show that trust in the internet is particularly influenced by the security perceived by consumers regarding the handling of their private data. Practical implications The results of this study provide several managerial implications for companies in this sector. Suggestions are offered for national and international organizations involved in regulating these markets. Originality/value The results of this research remedy, to a certain extent, the scarcity of empirical studies that have designed and validated measuring scales for the concepts of privacy, security, trust and loyalty to the internet, as well as testing the relationships between them.\"},\n",

If consumers are Bayesian, firms will not shroud information in equilibrium. However, shrouding may occur in an economy with some myopic (or unaware) consumers. Such shrouding creates an inefficiency, which firms may have an incentive to eliminate by educating their competitors\\' customers. However, if add-ons have close substitutes, a \"curse of debiasing\" arises, and firms will not be able to profitably debias consumers by unshrouding add-ons. In equilibrium, two kinds of exploitation coexist. Optimizing firms exploit myopic consumers through marketing schemes that shroud high-priced add-ons. In turn, sophisticated consumers exploit these marketing schemes. It is not possible to profitably drive away the business of sophisticates. It is also not possible to profitably lure either myopes or sophisticates to nonexploitative firms. We show that informational shrouding flourishes even in highly competitive markets, even in markets with costless advertising, and even when the shrouding generates allocational inefficiencies.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"ABSTRACT Persuading users to adopt new information technologies persists as an important problem confronting those responsible for implementing new information systems. In order to better understand and manage the process of new technology adoption, several theoretical models have been proposed, of which the technology acceptance model (TAM) has gained considerable support. Beliefs and attitudes represent significant constructs in TAM. A parallel research stream suggests that individual difference factors are important in information technology acceptance but does not explicate the process by which acceptance is influenced. The objective of this paper is to clarify this process by proposing a theoretical model wherein the relationship between individual differences and IT acceptance is hypothesized to be mediated by the constructs of the technology acceptance model. In essence then, these factors are viewed as influencing an individual's beliefs about an information technology innovation; this relationship is further supported by drawing upon extensive research in learning. The theoretical model was tested in an empirical study of 230 users of an information technology innovation. Results confirm the basic structure of the model, including the mediating role of beliefs. Results also identify several individual difference variables that have significant effects on TAM's beliefs. Theoretical contributions and practical implications that follow are discussed.\"},\n",

The principal observations regarding the wellness industry concern an expanding supply of and an insufficiently researched demand for wellness programmes. The quality dimension of wellness services is increasingly becoming the decisive competitive factor. For this reason quality management plays an important role. Market research shows that average three- to five-star hotels provide fairly comprehensive wellness facilities. Wellness hotels should therefore specialise in health information, individual care and a wide range of cultural and relaxation programmes. Although the same hotel can host cure and wellness guests at the same time, these two segments have to be considered separately when deciding on the marketing strategy. It is therefore assumed that wellness is pursued solely by ‘healthy’ people, the prime aim being prevention. ‘Normal cure’ guests aim to heal their illness.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Global virtual teams are internationally distributed groups of people with an organizational mandate to make or implement decisions with international components and implications. They are typically assigned tasks that are strategically important and highly complex. They rarely meet in person, conducting almost all of their interaction and decision making using communications technology. Although they play an increasingly important role in multinational organizations, little systematic is known about their dynamics or effectiveness. This study built a grounded theory of global virtual team processes and performance over time. We built a template based on Adaptive Structuration Theory (DeSanctis and Poole 1994) to guide our research, and we conducted a case study, observing three global virtual teams over a period of 21 months. Data were gathered using multiple methods, and qualitative methods were used to analyze them and generate a theory of global virtual team dynamics and effectiveness. First, we propose that effective global virtual team interaction comprises a series of communication incidents, each configured by aspects of the team's structural and process elements. Effective outcomes were associated with a fit among an interaction incident's form, decision process, and complexity. Second, effective global virtual teams sequence these incidents to generate a deep rhythm of regular face-to-face incidents interspersed with less intensive, shorter incidents using various media. These two insights are discussed with respect to other literature and are elaborated upon in several propositions. Implications for research and practice are also outlined.\"},\n",

The authors investigate how the social cues inherent in avatars influence consumers' affect and shopping value. In Study 1, social cues induce perceptions of Web site socialness, leading to increased pleasure and arousal, both of which positively influence flow, hedonic and utilitarian value, and patronage intentions. Study 2 finds that social cue–induced arousal leads to increased pleasure only for consumers who are involved with the product category. Moreover, the influence of arousal on hedonic value is stronger for women, flow does not lead to pleasure for older consumers, and utilitarian value is less important for this group than for their younger counterparts.

In spite of its importance and intuitive appeal, the extent of empirical support is equivocal and riddled with problems of conceptualizing and testing for coalignment. This paper evaluates alternate approaches to testing such a proposition and argues in favor of specifying coalignment as ‘profile deviation’, which states that coalignment is the degree to which strategic resource deployments adhere to an ‘ideal profile’ for a given environment. Subsequently, this proposition is tested across two time periods, and eight distinct environments in two different samples drawn from the PIMS data base. Results, which were generally robust across the two periods, strongly support the proposition of a positive performance impact of environment‐strategy coalignment.

To further the understanding of eWOM, the present study used data from a survey of 309 consumers to develop a 32-item self-report scale measuring consumer motivations for online opinion seeking. This study revealed eight distinct factors. Consumers seek the opinions of others online to reduce their risk, because others do it, to secure lower prices, to get information easily, by accident (unplanned), because it is cool, because they are stimulated by off-line inputs such as TV, and to get pre-purchase information. A second study using data from 109 consumers showed that: (1) the scales measuring these motivations are free from social desirability response bias and acquiescence, (2) other consumers’ information is more important than advertising, and (3) consumers are likely to continue to seek WOM online, thereby confirming its importance in ecommerce.'},\n",

One approach to such studies on drivers of social media usage behavior would be to revisit the technology acceptance model (TAM). The purpose of this paper is to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Decades of extensive research have focussed on validating the TAM, proposed by Davis (1986), for various types of information systems and communication technologies. TAM forecasts individual adoption and voluntary use of technology. This study examines individual adoption behavior of the most popular social networking site Facebook. The influences on the intention of using social networking based on individual's perceived ease of use (EU), the user's critical mass (CM), social networking site capability (CP), perceived playfulness (PP), trustworthiness (TW), and perceived usefulness (PU) is empirically examined with a primary data set of 398 users of Facebook gathered from a web-based questionnaire survey. Findings – The results demonstrate that the revised social media TAM model proposed in this study supports all the hypotheses of social media usage behavior. The results of this study provide evidence for the importance of additional key variables to TAM in considering user engagement on social media sites and other social-media-related business strategies. Originality/value – Based on our review of existing scientific literature on social media, few empirical studies have been conducted to scientifically evaluate and explain the usage behavior of social media using Facebook. A validated instrument of usage behavior of social media can provide usability experts and practitioners with a validated tool to assess social media acceptance and usage behavior. This can help us gain a better understanding of “who is and who is not using these sites, why and for what purposes” (Boyd and Ellison, 2007).\"},\n",

This attention is evident by the vast number of publications in scientific journals which have been published in recent years. Hence, a comprehensive literature review of recent and state-of-the-art papers is vital to draw a framework of the past, and to shed light on future directions. The aim of this paper is to review recently published papers in reverse logistic and closed-loop supply chain in scientific journals. A total of 382 papers published between January 2007 and March 2013 are selected and reviewed. The papers are then analyzed and categorized to construct a useful foundation of past research. Finally, gaps in the literature are identified to clarify and to suggest future research opportunities.'},\n",

We are beginning to understand how some of this information can be utilized to improve the users' experiences with interfaces and with one another. In this paper, we are interested in the personality of users. Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions, it has been shown to be useful in predicting job satisfaction, professional and romantic relationship success, and even preference for different interfaces. Until now, to accurately gauge users' personalities, they needed to take a personality test. This made it impractical to use personality analysis in many social media domains. In this paper, we present a method by which a user's personality can be accurately predicted through the publicly available information on their Twitter profile. We will describe the type of data collected, our methods of analysis, and the machine learning techniques that allow us to successfully predict personality. We then discuss the implications this has for social media design, interface design, and broader domains.\"},\n",

We conducted a review of the literature for potential determinants of fruit and vegetable intake in children and adolescents. Papers were identified from Medline and PsycINFO by using all combinations of the search terms: \"fruit(s) or vegetable(s)\" and \"children or adolescents\". Quantitative research examining determinants of fruit and/or vegetable intake among children and adolescents aged 6–18 years were included. The selection and review process was conducted according to a four-step protocol resulting in information on country, population, design, methodology, theoretical basis, instrument used for measuring intake, statistical analysis, included independent variables, and effect sizes. Ninety-eight papers were included. A large number of potential determinants have been studied among children and adolescents. However, for many presumed determinants convincing evidence is lacking, mostly because of paucity of studies. The determinants best supported by evidence are: age, gender, socio-economic position, preferences, parental intake, and home availability/accessibility. Girls and younger children tend to have a higher or more frequent intake than boys and older children. Socio-economic position, preferences, parental intake, and home availability/accessibility are all consistently positively associated with intake. The determinants most consistently supported by evidence are gender, age, socio-economic position, preferences, parental intake and home availability/accessibility. There is a need for internationally comparative, longitudinal, theory-based and multi-level studies taking both personal and environmental factors into account.

The financial benefits of quality, which had been assumed as a matter of faith in the \"religion of quality,\" are now being seriously questioned by cost-cutting executives, who cite the highly publicized financial failures of some companies prominent in the quality movement. In this increasingly results-oriented environment, managers must now justify their quality improvement efforts financially. The authors present the \"return on quality\" approach, which is based on the assumptions that (1) quality is an investment, (2) quality efforts must be financially accountable, (3) it is possible to spend too much on quality, and (4) not all quality expenditures are equally valid. The authors then provide a managerial framework that can be used to guide quality improvement efforts. This framework has several attractive features, including ensured managerial relevance and financial accountability.'},\n",

Management should focus on gaining customer loyalty by enhancing customer perceptions of service quality and increasing as perceived by the consumer value. Although previous studies have addressed the importance of service quality, satisfaction, perceived value, and image, the precise nature of the relationships that exist between these constructs and the understanding of their effect on customer behaviour still remains a key issue. This empirical study seeks to understand the relationships that exist between service quality and perceived value and how they impact customer satisfaction, corporate image, and behavioural intentions. The proposed model indicates that delivering high quality service and creating superior customer value can result in achieve high customer satisfaction, thus effecting the firm's corporate image, and ultimately leading to consumer retention.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Research on ecosystem services has grown markedly in recent years. However, few studies are embedded in a social process designed to ensure effective management of ecosystem services. Most research has focused only on biophysical and valuation assessments of putative services. As a mission-oriented discipline, ecosystem service research should be user-inspired and user-useful, which will require that researchers respond to stakeholder needs from the outset and collaborate with them in strategy development and implementation. Here we provide a pragmatic operational model for achieving the safeguarding of ecosystem services. The model comprises three phases: assessment, planning, and management. Outcomes of social, biophysical, and valuation assessments are used to identify opportunities and constraints for implementation. The latter then are transformed into user-friendly products to identify, with stakeholders, strategic objectives for implementation (the planning phase). The management phase undertakes and coordinates actions that achieve the protection of ecosystem services and ensure the flow of these services to beneficiaries. This outcome is achieved via mainstreaming, or incorporating the safeguarding of ecosystem services into the policies and practices of sectors that deal with land- and water-use planning. Management needs to be adaptive and should be institutionalized in a suite of learning organizations that are representative of the sectors that are concerned with decision-making and planning. By following the phases of our operational model, projects for safeguarding ecosystem services are likely to empower stakeholders to implement effective on-the-ground management that will achieve resilience of the corresponding social-ecological systems.'},\n",

The purpose of this paper is to explore critical technological advancements using a value co-creation lens to provide insights into service innovations that impact ecosystems. The paper provides examples from tourism and hospitality industries as an information dependent service management context. Design/methodology/approach The research synthesizes prevailing theories of co-creation, service ecosystems, networks and technology disruption with emerging technological developments. Findings Findings highlight the need for research into service innovations in the tourism and hospitality sector at both macro-market and micro-firm levels, emanating from the rapid and radical nature of technological advancements. Specifically, the paper identifies three areas of likely future disruption in service experiences that may benefit from immediate attention: extra-sensory experiences, hyper-personalized experiences and beyond-automation experiences. Research limitations/implications Tourism and hospitality services prevail under varying levels of infrastructure, organization and cultural constraints. This paper provides an overview of potential disruptions and developments and does not delve into individual destination types and settings. This will require future work that conceptualizes and examines how stakeholders may adapt within specific contexts. Social implications Technological disruptions impact all facets of life. A comprehensive picture of developments here provides policymakers with nuanced perspectives to better prepare for impending change. Originality/value Guest experiences in tourism and hospitality by definition take place in hostile environments that are outside the safety and familiarity of one’s own surroundings. The emergence of smart environments will redefine how customers navigate their experiences. At a conceptual level, this requires a complete rethink of how stakeholders should leverage technologies, engage and reengineer services to remain competitive. The paper illustrates how technology disrupts industry structures and stimulates value co-creation at the micro and macro-societal level.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Companies are used to bringing in customers to participate in focus groups, usability laboratories, and market research surveys in order to help in the development of new products and services. And for improving products that customers know well, those tools are highly sophisticated. For example, knowledgeable customers are adept at identifying the specific scent of leather they expect in a luxury vehicle or at helping to tune the sound of a motorcycle engine to just the timbre that evokes feelings of power. But to go beyond improvements to the familiar, companies need to identify and meet needs that customers may not yet recognize. To accomplish that task, a set of techniques called empathic design can help. Rather than bring the customers to the company, empathic design calls for company representatives to watch customers using products and services in the context of their own environments. By doing so, managers can often identify unexpected uses for their products, just as the product manager of a cooking oil did when he observed a neighbor spraying the oil on the blades of a lawn mower to reduce grass buildup. They can also uncover problems that customers don't mention in surveys, as the president of Nissan Design did when he watched a couple struggling to remove the backseat of a competitor's minivan in order to transport a couch. The five-step process Dorothy Leonard and Jeffrey Rayport describe in detail is a relatively low-cost, low-risk way to identify customer needs, and it has the potential to redirect a company's existing technological capabilities toward entirely new businesses.\"},\n",

We also searched prescribing information, relevant Web sites, reference lists and citation sections of recovered articles, and abstracts presented at recent conferences.Study SelectionRandomized controlled trials were selected if they were at least 12 weeks in duration, compared incretin therapy with placebo or other diabetes medication, and reported hemoglobin A1c data in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes.Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. Differences were resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses were conducted for several efficacy and safety outcomes.ResultsOf 355 potentially relevant articles identified, 51 were retrieved for detailed evaluation and 29 met the inclusion criteria. Incretins lowered hemoglobin A1c compared with placebo (weighted mean difference, −0.97% [95% confidence interval {CI}, −1.13% to −0.81%] for GLP-1 analogues and −0.74% [95% CI, −0.85% to −0.62%] for DPP4 inhibitors) and were noninferior to other hypoglycemic agents. Glucagonlike peptide 1 analogues resulted in weight loss (1.4 kg and 4.8 kg vs placebo and insulin, respectively) while DPP4 inhibitors were weight neutral. Glucagonlike peptide 1 analogues had more gastrointestinal side effects (risk ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.0-4.2] for nausea and 3.2 [95% CI, 2.5-4.4] for vomiting). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors had an increased risk of infection (risk ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.4] for nasopharyngitis and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.0-2.2] for urinary tract infection) and headache (risk ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7]). All but 3 trials had a 30-week or shorter duration; thus, long-term efficacy and safety could not be evaluated.ConclusionsIncretin therapy offers an alternative option to currently available hypoglycemic agents for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, with modest efficacy and a favorable weight-change profile. Careful postmarketing surveillance for adverse effects, especially among the DPP4 inhibitors, and continued evaluation in longer-term studies and in clinical practice are required to determine the role of this new class among current pharmacotherapies for type 2 diabetes.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Many business customers today consolidate their supply bases and implement preferred supplier programs. Consequently, vendors increasingly face the alternative of either gaining a key supplier status with their customers or being pushed into the role of a backup supplier. As product and price become less important differentiators, suppliers of routinely purchased products search for new ways to differentiate themselves in a buyer–seller relationship. This research investigates avenues for differentiation through value creation in business-to-business relationships. The results suggest that relationship benefits display a stronger potential for differentiation in key supplier relationships than cost considerations. The authors identify service support and personal interaction as core differentiators, followed by a supplier's know-how and its ability to improve a customer's time to market. Product quality and delivery performance, along with acquisition costs and operation costs, display a moderate potential to help a firm gain and maintain key supplier status. Finally, price shows the weakest potential for differentiation.\"},\n",

These recommendations consider the use of SP methods to estimate both use and non-use (passive-use) values, and cover the broad SP domain, including contingent valuation and discrete choice experiments. We focus on applications to public goods in the context of the environment and human health but also consider ways in which the proposed recommendations might apply to other common areas of application. The recommendations recognize that SP results may be used and reused (benefit transfers) by governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations, and that all such applications must be considered. The intended result is a set of guidelines for SP studies that is more comprehensive than that of the original National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Blue Ribbon Panel on contingent valuation, is more germane to contemporary applications, and reflects the two decades of research since that time. We also distinguish between practices for which accumulated research is sufficient to support recommendations and those for which greater uncertainty remains. The goal of this article is to raise the quality of SP studies used to support decision making and promote research that will further enhance the practice of these studies worldwide.'},\n",

This article examines the issue of supplier selection in situations where the firm is considering a partnership type of relationship with potential suppliers. The argument is made that partnerships are different in nature than traditional buyer‐supplier relationships, and thus require the consideration of additional factors in supplier selection. This study combines a literature review with the use of case studies of firms involved in buyer‐supplier partnerships to develop additional factors that should be considered in the selection of supply partners. Four categories of additional factors are developed: (1) financial issues, (2) organizational culture and strategy, (3) technology, and (4) a group of miscellaneous factors. The issues included in these categories tend to be longer term and more qualitative than factors included in traditional supplier selection models. The article suggests that these additional factors supplement, rather than replace, the more traditional factors in developing strategic partnerships with suppliers.'},\n",

We found that, amongst content features, URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability.

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract Market segmentation is an established technique in commercial marketing. It can be used by archivists and records managers to help them gain a wider understanding of their users. Segmentation can be based on demographic criteria, or other models can be employed that are more specific to studies of the use and users of records. Segmentation can be used to good effect in design and evaluation of user-focused systems. Standards for segmentation would be beneficial but their development will not be a simple task. Notes Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users’ Sexton et al., ‘User Feedback’. The LEADERS project, available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/leaders-project/ (accessed 6 January 2005), sought to develop innovative tools for delivering archives to users, linking Encoded Archival Description (EAD) finding aids to Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) transcripts and digital images of archival materials. The author is indebted to Elizabeth Hallam Smith, Susan Hockey, Anna Sexton and Elizabeth Shepherd for their contributions to early drafts of this article. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records. Hedstrom, ‘How do Archivists Make Electronic Archives Usable and Accessible?,’ 12. Tibbo, ‘Primarily History,’ 1. Prom, ‘The EAD Cookbook,’ 266. The same theme recurs in Gilliland-Swetland, ‘An Exploration of K-12 User Needs for Digital Primary Source Materials,’ 143; Duff, ‘Understanding the Information-seeking Behaviour of Archival Researchers in a Digital Age,’ 332; Yakel, ‘Impact of Internet-based Discovery Tools on Use and Users of Archives,’ 199. All these authors reiterate calls to action made in the 1980s, for example by Freeman, ‘In the Eye of the Beholder’; Conway, ‘Facts and Frameworks’; Dowler, ‘The Role of Use in Defining Archival Practice and Principles’. Since the 1980s much work on user access has been done, but many aspects remain unexplored. Prom, User Interactions with Electronic Finding Aids in a Controlled Setting. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 82 – 87, 113. Ibid., 155 – 62. The employment of systematic user studies as a benchmark for appraisal and archival acquisition was suggested by Dowler, ‘The Role of Use,’ 75; but the recent emphasis on functional and macro appraisal has militated against this approach, and proposals to focus on users and use have been attacked, notably by Cook, ‘Viewing the World Upside Down,’ 123 – 34. See, however, Eastwood, ‘Towards a Social Theory of Appraisal’, and the remarks of Horsman, ‘Appraisal on Wooden Shoes,’ 41, on the decision to revise the Dutch PIVOT macro-appraisal methodology following users' objections that the original methodology did not take their needs into account. The arguments against excluding considerations of use from appraisal decisions were cogently stated by Greene, ‘The Surest Proof’. Greene acknowledged the limitations of utilitarian criteria, particularly the impossibility of measuring future rather than past or present use, but also emphasised the futility of preserving records that are not in some way useful. The UK National Archives now seeks comments from user groups on all its ‘operational selection policies’ governing selection of records for long-term preservation. See Twigge, ‘Public Records, Public Consultation’. As noted by Cook, ‘Viewing the World Upside Down,’ endnote 7, ignoring indirect users leads to an underestimation of the impact of archives and records services. The perspectives of indirect users are particularly relevant to appraisal decisions; arguably they may be less important in design or evaluation of access systems. McDonald and Dunbar, Market Segmentation, 10. Most marketing textbooks provide descriptions of market segmentation from a commercial viewpoint. See, for example, Kotler et al., Principles of Marketing, chap. 9. Hallam Smith, ‘Customer Focus and Marketing in Archive Service Delivery,’ 36. Rowley, ‘From Users to Customers?,’ 160. Such opportunities are discussed further in Digicult, New Technologies for the Cultural and Scientific Heritage Sector, 21 – 38. LEADERS undertook some exploration of this dimension of EAD.

Hawkins et al., ‘Socio-economic Features of UK Public Library Users,’ 262. For an example of the latter approach see Keng, Jung, and Wirtz, ‘Segmentation of Library Visitors in Singapore,’ 24. A scale of 1 – 5 is sometimes called a ‘Likert’ scale, although strictly speaking this name applies only to scales used to measure agreement with assertions. More complex scales for measuring computer literacy have also been developed. See Bunz, The Computer-Email-Web Fluency Scale. The studies examined were Buttler, ‘The Results of a Survey of Visitors to Warwickshire County Record Office,’ 178; Cherry and Duff, Improving Access to Early Canadiana, 11; Zhang, ‘Scholarly Use of Internet-based Electronic Resources,’ 749; Marcella and Baxter, ‘Information Need, Information Seeking Behaviour and Participation, with Special Reference to Needs Related to Citizenship,’ 139; PSQG surveys 2001 and 2002, available from http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives/psqg/survey.htm (accessed 6 January 2005); A2A user analysis, 2002, available from http://www.a2a.org.uk/stats/NewUserStats.htm (accessed 6 January 2005); Keng et al., ‘Segmentation of Library Visitors in Singapore,’ 23. More encouragingly, many of the questions asked in the recent Archives Awareness Month evaluation were framed to provide data directly comparable with the 2002 PSQG survey: National Council on Archives, Archives Awareness Month, 34.

See http://www.statistics.gov.uk/nsbase/methods_quality/ns_sec/soc2000.asp (accessed 6 January 2005). None of the classification schemes include students, retired people or the unemployed; in a user study, supplementary categories are likely to be required. Marcella and Baxter, ‘Information Need, Information Seeking Behaviour and Participation, with Special Reference to Needs Related to Citizenship’; Hawkins, Morris, and Sumsion, ‘Socio-economic Features of UK Public Library Users’; MORI, Visitors to Museums and Galleries in the UK. This has replaced the Social Class (SC) and Socio-economic Group (SEG) classifications formerly used by the Office of the Registrar General. For advice on selecting formats see Black, Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences, 306 – 29. As, for example, in Sexton et al., ‘User Feedback,’ Appendix. For an analysis of the extensive literature from these fields see Case, Looking for Information. Williams, ‘Data Collection and Management in the Archival Domain,’ 66. In many organisations data about internal use may be considered more sensitive or less suited to external dissemination. Moreover, in the UK much of the work has been driven by the Government's agenda for archives; there has not been the same pressure for publicly accessible measures of records management outcomes. See, for example, Roper, ‘The Academic Use of Archives’; Beattie, ‘An Archival User Study’; Orbach, ‘The View from the Researcher's Desk: Historians' Perceptions of Research and Repositories’; Duff and Johnson, ‘Accidentally Found on Purpose,’ 472 – 96; Tibbo, ‘Primarily History in America’. Similar studies from outside the archival domain are cited by Tibbo, ‘Primarily History’. Not all employ segmentation techniques, but many do. The author knows of very few user studies in records management. The most thoughtful of the three or four user-focused articles published in the Records Management Journal is Day, ‘Why Are We Here?’; see also Chown, ‘Establishing a Profile of the Users of a Records Management System’. Few studies of archive users recognise use by organisational staff and records creators. A notable exception is Yakel and Bost, ‘Understanding Administrative Use and Users in University Archives’. Variations on this dichotomy were proposed by Kotler and Andreasen, Strategic Marketing for Nonprofit Organizations, 170 – 71 (non-users, former/lapsed users, first-time/occasional users, regular/established users) and Sabin and Samuels, Towards a Better Understanding of Non-users (indifferent, outsiders, latent supporters, personal questers, advocates). Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 155 – 56. AS 4390.1-1996, Records Management. Pt 1, General. Sec 8.1 See also National Archives of Australia, Why Records are Kept. This article is not the place to summarise, or add to, the debate on whether there are reasons for record-keeping unconnected with the records' actual or potential use. The arguments are summarised in Greene, ‘The Surest Proof,’ 142 – 45. It suffices to note that the model presented here shows a user focus, in contrast to the supplier focus sometimes apparent in the Australian discourse. One possible answer is that the community expects organisations to be accountable, but in the Australian model accountability apparently does not form part of ‘community expectations’. The meaning of ‘accountability’ is widely discussed in the professional literature, but there is little discussion of what is meant by ‘business purposes’ or ‘business use’. Many writers apparently believe that the meaning of ‘business purposes’ is self-evident; in practice this means that its boundaries are undefined. The term has often been interpreted to mean only the business of individual record creators or the organisation that employs them; but when records are more widely accessible they can be also used to support the business of other organisations or individuals, even to the detriment of the organisation or individual with whom they originated. The definition of ‘business purposes’ presented here does not differentiate between users, but focuses on use. Users are categorised separately. For the growing literature on accountability see, for example, McKemmish, The Smoking Gun; Meijer, ‘Anticipating Accountability Processes’; Solomon and Solomon, Corporate Governance and Accountability. Cultural use should not be equated with research, since research can be undertaken for business as well as cultural purposes. Academic research is a type of cultural use; however, cultural use is not limited to academics or any other category of users. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 156 – 57. Evidence can be defined as ‘ground for belief’ in the truth or validity of something needing proof: Phelan and Reynolds, Argument and Evidence, 99. Records provide evidence not only in courts of law but in any situation requiring confirmation that something was done or that it was done correctly. This definition is doubtless over-simplified. Information science literature provides many discussions of the complex meanings of ‘information’, together with many typologies of information use. Attempts have been made to relate some of these to the use of records (see e.g. Yakel, ‘Thinking Inside and Outside the Boxes,’ 146), but these are not always wholly convincing. The word ‘associations’ is used by museum curators to refer to the value of objects arising from their previous use or their connection with a particular occasion. Some records are valued for sentimental or symbolic reasons because of their association with an individual, organisation, place or event; see O'Toole, ‘The Symbolic Significance of Archives’. Schellenberg, Modern Archives, 139 – 60. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 148 – 51, 156 – 57. The nuances of the word ‘evidence’ are only beginning to be explored in archival literature. To some archivists, ‘evidence’ is what records are; ‘information’ is something that they contain, or can be derived from studying them. For a contrasting view, see Brothman, ‘Afterglow’. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 156. Ibid., 156 – 61. Ibid., 157 – 60. A similar approach could be used to collate other variables, such as materials used and intensity of use by different groups. The charting methods discussed earlier in this article could also be employed. The figures do not depict research findings, but reflect the experience of the author and his colleagues in organisations which create records or have custody of records created by others. In an organisational context, records created by one member of a team or workgroup may also be used by other members of the team. However, it may be surmised that patterns of use will differ little between team members and creators. In Table 3 they are treated as a single group. See, for example, Rowley's suggested categories: general public; professionals; academic users; business users; ‘information intermediaries’ such as agents and consultants (Rowley, ‘From Users to Customers?,’ 158). The first PSQG surveys asked users to choose from: personal interest; professional researcher; media research; business or public body; academic staff; research degree; taught degree/further education; adult education; school staff; school student (Ailes and Watt, ‘Survey of Visitors,’ 188). In 2002 the list was changed to: personal leisure; non-leisure personal or family business; education as student/researcher; education as teacher; connection with employment. A PSQG report acknowledged that this list still has overlaps (PSQG Performance Indicators Working Party, Towards Generic and Universal PIs for Archives, 6). Some studies, including the PSQG surveys in 1999 and 2001, have resorted to including a category of ‘other’ users. Freeman, ‘In the Eye of the Beholder,’ 117, noted this as a convenient but meaningless solution. See also Blais and Enns, ‘From Paper Archives to People Archives,’ 112, endnote 31. Buttler, ‘The Results of a Survey,’ 176. Arguably what underlies the confusion is an assumption that cultural use and external use of archives are co-extensive, and do not require separate measures. The same assumption underlies Schellenberg's appraisal model (Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 151). However, as already noted, external use is not exclusively cultural, and vice versa. Methven et al., Measuring Performance, 30. An alternative taxonomy, proposed in Conway, Partners in Research, 50 – 51, separates academic from other occupational users, on the grounds that research undertaken by academics has a broader scope. Although it may often be broader, it is not necessarily so. Available from http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/ (accessed 6 January 2005). Borgman, ‘All Users of Information Retrieval Systems are Not Created Equal,’ 238. History is discussed here merely as an example. Similar considerations apply to other disciplines. Although all users of records are using historical sources (in the sense that the records were created in the past), not all use records to study history: see Gilliland-Swetland, ‘An Exploration of K-12 User Needs,’ 144. Case, ‘The Collection and Use of Information by Some American Historians,’ 67. Thesaurus construction is more usually encountered in the context of providing subject access points for descriptions of holdings, but the issues are the same when segmenting users' areas of study. A brief summary, emphasising the different relational structures of whole/part, genus/species and type/instance, is in Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 234 – 36. For more detailed advice see Aitchison, Gilchrist, and Bawden, Thesaurus Construction and Use. As the Churchill example shows, the more topics that are combined, the more specific the area of study. A specificity measure should also take account of the broadness or narrowness of each topic concerned. Political leaders (broad topic) and the Second World War (broad topic) is much less specific than Churchill (narrow topic) and D-Day (narrow topic). How one measures the relative specificity of Political leaders and D-Day and Churchill and the Second World War remains unclear. Kiestra, Stokmans, and Kamphuis, ‘End-users Searching the Online Catalogue’. Kelly and Cool, ‘The Effects of Topic Familiarity on Information Search Behavior’. LEADERS assessed this as ‘familiarity with research interest’: Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users,’ 44 – 45. For example, knowledge of library systems, which may generate false expectations about the nature of records or finding-aids: Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users,’ 45. PSQG Surveys of Visitors to British Archives 1999 – 2002, available from http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives/psqg/survey.htm (accessed 6 January 2005); Zhang, ‘Scholarly Use of Internet-based Electronic Resources,’ 751 – 52. Dowler, ‘The Role of Use,’ 79. Blais and Enns, ‘From Paper Archives to People Archives,’ 109. Bearman, ‘User Presentation Language in Archives’; Gagnon-Arguin, ‘Les questions de recherche comme matériau d'études des usagers’; Martin, ‘An Analysis of Remote Reference Correspondence at a Large Academic Manuscripts Collection’; Duff and Johnson, ‘A Virtual Expression of Need’. A possible taxonomy of research stages, adapted from Chu, ‘Literary Critics at Work and Their Information Needs’, is ‘idea generation, preparation, elaboration, analysis, writing, dissemination’; but this model presupposes academic research and is probably less applicable to other types of investigative work. White, ‘The Communications Behavior of Academic Economists in Research Phases’, offered a three-stage model (problem definition, data collection, interpretation) which may be applicable more generally, and broadly similar models were suggested by Bearman and Trant, Unifying Our Cultural Memory and Sarantakos, Social Research, 276. Many writers have noted that research is not necessarily a linear process. See for example Miller and Tegler, ‘Online Searching and the Research Process’. Preliminary findings on user behaviour at certain phases of research in archives were reported by Dowler, ‘The Role of Use,’ 79, and more extensively by Duff and Johnson, ‘Accidentally Found on Purpose,’ 480 – 95. Ellis, ‘A Behavioural Approach to Information Retrieval Design’. Ross, ‘Position Paper on Integrity and Authenticity of Digital Cultural Heritage Objects’. In 2003 a PSQG report left unresolved the question of ‘whether it is possible to identify broad generic categories of material consulted by users’ (PSQG Performance Indicators Working Party, Towards Generic and Universal PIs, 11). Various models are available: Jenkinson, A Manual of Archive Administration, 192 – 93 categorised ‘English archives’ as public, semi-public, private, ecclesiastical or artificial; Procter and Cook, Manual of Archival Description, 13 – 14 proposed the concept of ‘management groups’ for categorising archival holdings. There is scope for assessing how far such classifications are appropriate for user studies. The main obstacle to random sampling is often the difficulty of obtaining the ‘sampling frame’, the list of all members of the group from which the sample is taken. The principles and some practical problems of all three methods were described by Maxwell-Stewart, Sheppard, and Yeo, Hospital Patient Case Records, 16 – 21 in the context of selecting records for preservation; broadly similar issues arise when employing these techniques in user studies. For a fuller explanation see Sarantakos, Social Research, 139 – 64. Covey, Usage and Usability Assessment, sec. 4.2.1. Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users,’ 38 – 42; Sexton et al., ‘User Feedback,’ 191. In 2003 the Cultural Content Forum analysed 94 user profiles, mostly from museums but including some from archival institutions. None used a model recommended in a published source or based on previous research (Cultural Content Forum, Evaluation of Digital Cultural Content, 9).

       "  'abstract': \"Today's children and adolescents are immersed in both traditional and new forms of digital media. Research on traditional media, such as television, has identified health concerns and negative outcomes that correlate with the duration and content of viewing. Over the past decade, the use of digital media, including interactive and social media, has grown, and research evidence suggests that these newer media offer both benefits and risks to the health of children and teenagers. Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support, and new opportunities to access health promotion messages and information. Risks of such media include negative health effects on sleep, attention, and learning; a higher incidence of obesity and depression; exposure to inaccurate, inappropriate, or unsafe content and contacts; and compromised privacy and confidentiality. This technical report reviews the literature regarding these opportunities and risks, framed around clinical questions, for children from birth to adulthood. To promote health and wellness in children and adolescents, it is important to maintain adequate physical activity, healthy nutrition, good sleep hygiene, and a nurturing social environment. A healthy Family Media Use Plan (www.healthychildren.org/MediaUsePlan) that is individualized for a specific child, teenager, or family can identify an appropriate balance between screen time/online time and other activities, set boundaries for accessing content, guide displays of personal information, encourage age-appropriate critical thinking and digital literacy, and support open family communication and implementation of consistent rules about media use.\"},\n",

The model is applied on differences between Western and Japanese patterns of knowledge management. These are related to organizational characteristics, such as employment systems, career patterns, and organization structure. Effective knowledge management is argued to require departures from the logic of hierarchical organization and the M-form structure. The alternative N-form is characterized and suggested as more appropriate. It entails combination of knowledge rather than its division, which is the basic principle in the M-form. Other attributes of the N-form are: temporary constellations of people, the importance of personnel at 'lower levels', lateral communication, a catalytic and architectural role for top management, strategies aimed at focusing and economies of depth, and heterarchical structures.\"},\n",

This development of organization theory will be hastened by increased understanding of the importance of the choice of definitions, tautologies, analytical techniques, and types of evidence. The two literatures of agency theory are briefly discussed in light of these issues. Because accounting is an integral part of the structure of every organization, the development of a theory of organizations will be closely associated with the development of a theory of accounting. This theory will explain why organizations take the form they do, why they behave as they do, and why accounting practices take the form they do. Because such positive theories as these are required for purposeful decision making, their development will provide a better scientific basis for the decisions of managers, standard-setting boards, and government regulatory bodies.'},\n",

Topics explored in Parts 2 to 4 include aquatic biodiversity; the ecosystem approach to fisheries and to aquaculture; climate change impacts and responses; the sector’s contribution to food security and human nutrition; and issues related to international trade, consumer protection and sustainable value chains. Global developments in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, selected ocean pollution concerns and FAO’s efforts to improve capture fishery data are also discussed. The issue concludes with the outlook for the sector, including projections to 2030. As always, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and up-to-date information to a wide audience, including policy-makers, managers, scientists, stakeholders and indeed all those interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.'},\n",

We unpack this construct into one with two dimensions we term the balance dimension of ambidexterity (BD) and the combined dimension of ambidexterity (CD). BD corresponds to a firm's orientation to maintain a close relative balance between exploratory and exploitative activities, whereas CD corresponds to their combined magnitude. We reason that these dimensions are conceptually distinct, and rely on different causal mechanisms to enhance firm performance. We find that over and above their independent effects, concurrent high levels of BD and CD yield synergistic benefits. We also find that BD is more beneficial to resource-constrained firms, whereas CD is more beneficial to firms having greater access to internal and/or external resources. These results indicate that managers in resource-constrained contexts may benefit from a focus on managing trade-offs between exploration and exploitation demands, but for firms that have access to sufficient resources, the simultaneous pursuit of exploration and exploitation is both possible and desirable.\"},\n",

Studies of rubrics in higher education have been undertaken in a wide range of disciplines and for multiple purposes, including increasing student achievement, improving instruction and evaluating programmes. While, student perceptions of rubrics are generally positive and some authors report positive responses to rubric use by instructors, others noted a tendency for instructors to resist using them. Two studies suggested that rubric use was associated with improved academic performance, while one did not. The potential of rubrics to identify the need for improvements in courses and programmes has been demonstrated. Studies of the validity of rubrics have shown that clarity and appropriateness of language is a central concern. Studies of rater reliability tend to show that rubrics can lead to a relatively common interpretation of student performance. Suggestions for future research include the use of more rigorous research methods, more attention to validity and reliability, a closer focus on learning and research on rubric use in diverse educational contexts.

Design/methodology/approach Underpinning the discussion is that complexity, ambiguity, fuzziness, chaos, change, uncertainty and unpredictability are characteristics of a market economy; that qualitative and subjective interpretation is necessary to add the spark of life to marketing data; and that general marketing theory needs more attention from researchers. Practical implications The proper use of methodology and the generation of better marketing theory will make it easier for practitioners to reach the right decisions. Findings Quantitative and qualitative research processes are not by nature antagonistic, although their advocates may be; quantitative methodology carries qualitative “bugs”, necessary for its sustenance. Originality/value The article ends with a recommendation that every researcher in marketing should design his or her individual research approach, one that suits the personality of the researcher. As an example, the author presents his own current methodology‐in‐use, interactive research.'},\n",

Indeed, it is often small clues that influence a customer\\'s overall perception of an experience. Customers form perceptions based on the technical performance of the service (functional clues), the tangibles associated with the service (mechanic clues), and the behavior and appearance of service providers (humanic clues). Functional, mechanic, and humanic clues play specific roles in creating the customer\\'s service experience, influencing both rational and emotional perceptions of service quality.

       "  'abstract': 'Objectives To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for obesity. Data sources Seventeen electronic databases were searched [MEDLINE; EMBASE; PreMedline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; The Cochrane Library including the Cochrane Systematic Reviews Database, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, DARE, NHS EED and HTA databases; Web of Knowledge Science Citation Index (SCI); Web of Knowledge ISI Proceedings; PsycInfo; CRD databases; BIOSIS; and databases listing ongoing clinical trials] from inception to August 2008. Bibliographies of related papers were assessed and experts were contacted to identify additional published and unpublished references Review methods Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Inclusion criteria were applied to the full text using a standard form. Interventions investigated were open and laparoscopic bariatric surgical procedures in widespread current use compared with one another and with non-surgical interventions. Population comprised adult patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 and young obese people. Main outcomes were at least one of the following after at least 12 months follow-up: measures of weight change; quality of life (QoL); perioperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity; change in obesity-related comorbidities; cost-effectiveness. Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review for comparisons of Surgery versus Surgery were RCTs. For comparisons of Surgery versus Non-surgical procedures eligible studies were RCTs, controlled clinical trials and prospective cohort studies (with a control cohort). Studies eligible for inclusion in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness were full cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, cost-benefit analyses and cost-consequence analyses. One reviewer performed data extraction, which was checked by two reviewers independently. Two reviewers independently applied quality assessment criteria and differences in opinion were resolved at each stage. Studies were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of the results of all included studies. In the economic model the analysis was developed for three patient populations, those with BMI ≥ 40; BMI ≥ 30 and < 40 with Type 2 diabetes at baseline; and BMI ≥ 30 and < 35. Models were applied with assumptions on costs and comorbidity. Results A total of 5386 references were identified of which 26 were included in the clinical effectiveness review: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies compared surgery with non-surgical interventions and 20 RCTs compared different surgical procedures. Bariatric surgery was a more effective intervention for weight loss than non-surgical options. In one large cohort study weight loss was still apparent 10 years after surgery, whereas patients receiving conventional treatment had gained weight. Some measures of QoL improved after surgery, but not others. After surgery statistically fewer people had metabolic syndrome and there was higher remission of Type 2 diabetes than in non-surgical groups. In one large cohort study the incidence of three out of six comorbidities assessed 10 years after surgery was significantly reduced compared with conventional therapy. Gastric bypass (GBP) was more effective for weight loss than vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). Laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) was more effective than AGB in one study. GBP and banded GBP led to similar weight loss and results for GBP versus LISG and VBG versus AGB were equivocal. All comparisons of open versus laparoscopic surgeries found similar weight losses in each group. Comorbidities after surgery improved in all groups, but with no significant differences between different surgical interventions. Adverse event reporting varied; mortality ranged from none to 10%. Adverse events from conventional therapy included intolerance to medication, acute cholecystitis and gastrointestinal problems. Major adverse events following surgery, some necessitating reoperation, included anastomosis leakage, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, band slippage and band erosion. Bariatric surgery was cost-effective in comparison to non-surgical treatment in the reviewed published estimates of cost-effectiveness. However, these estimates are likely to be unreliable and not generalisable because of methodological shortcomings and the modelling assumptions made. Therefore a new economic model was developed. Surgical management was more costly than non-surgical management in each of the three patient populations analysed, but gave improved outcomes. For morbid obesity, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) (base case) ranged between £2000 and £4000 per QALY gained. They remained within the range regarded as cost-effective from an NHS decision-making perspective when assumptions for deterministic sensitivity analysis were changed. For BMI ≥ 30 and < 40, ICERs were £18,930 at two years and £1397 at 20 years, and for BMI ≥ 30 and < 35, ICERs were £60,754 at two years and £12,763 at 20 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses produced ICERs which were generally within the range considered cost-effective, particularly at the long twenty year time horizons, although for the BMI 30-35 group some ICERs were above the acceptable range. Conclusions Bariatric surgery appears to be a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for moderately to severely obese people compared with non-surgical interventions. Uncertainties remain and further research is required to provide detailed data on patient QoL; impact of surgeon experience on outcome; late complications leading to reoperation; duration of comorbidity remission; resource use. Good-quality RCTs will provide evidence on bariatric surgery for young people and for adults with class I or class II obesity. New research must report on the resolution and/or development of comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension so that the potential benefits of early intervention can be assessed.'},\n",

The two objectives of this paper are: (1) to clarify the nature of the linkage construct, and (2) to report on a project that developed and tested measures of the social dimension of linkage. According to our research, the linkage construct has two dimensions:1. Intellectual: the content of information technology and business plans are internally consistent and externally valid.2. Social: the IS and business executives understand each others' objectives and plans.We conducted a study of measurement issues associated with the social dimension of linkage. The following candidate measures of linkage were examined:1. Cross references between written business and information technology plans;2. S and business executives' mutual understanding of each other's current objectives;3. Congruence between IS and business executives' long-term visions for information technology deployment;4. Executives' self-reported rating of linkage. Data were collected from 10 business units in three large Canadian life insurance companies. In addition to examining written documents such as strategic plans and minutes of steering committee meetings, extensive interviews were conducted with information systems and business unit executives. Based on this data, understanding of current objectives and shared vision for the utilization of information technology are proposed as the most promising potential measures for short- and long-term aspects of the social dimension of linkage, respectively. With some precautions, self-reports may also be used as a surrogate measure for short-term linkage.\"},\n",

This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social.

MHapps and other technology-based solutions have the potential to play an important part in the future of mental health care; however, there is no single guide for the development of evidence-based MHapps. Many currently available MHapps lack features that would greatly improve their functionality, or include features that are not optimized. Furthermore, MHapp developers rarely conduct or publish trial-based experimental validation of their apps. Indeed, a previous systematic review revealed a complete lack of trial-based evidence for many of the hundreds of MHapps available.To guide future MHapp development, a set of clear, practical, evidence-based recommendations is presented for MHapp developers to create better, more rigorous apps.A literature review was conducted, scrutinizing research across diverse fields, including mental health interventions, preventative health, mobile health, and mobile app design.Sixteen recommendations were formulated. Evidence for each recommendation is discussed, and guidance on how these recommendations might be integrated into the overall design of an MHapp is offered. Each recommendation is rated on the basis of the strength of associated evidence. It is important to design an MHapp using a behavioral plan and interactive framework that encourages the user to engage with the app; thus, it may not be possible to incorporate all 16 recommendations into a single MHapp.Randomized controlled trials are required to validate future MHapps and the principles upon which they are designed, and to further investigate the recommendations presented in this review. Effective MHapps are required to help prevent mental health problems and to ease the burden on health systems.'},\n",

To solve real-world issues, various types of AI such as analytical, functional, interactive, textual, and visual AI can be applied to enhance the intelligence and capabilities of an application. However, developing an effective AI model is a challenging task due to the dynamic nature and variation in real-world problems and data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on “AI-based Modeling” with the principles and capabilities of potential AI techniques that can play an important role in developing intelligent and smart systems in various real-world application areas including business, finance, healthcare, agriculture, smart cities, cybersecurity and many more. We also emphasize and highlight the research issues within the scope of our study.

       "  'abstract': \"This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of farmer field schools in improving intermediate outcomes (such as knowledge and pesticide use) and final outcomes (such as agricultural yields, incomes and empowerment) in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), as well as implementation factors associated with programme success and failure. The review sythesises evidence from 92 impact evaluations, of which 15 were of sufficient quality for policy‐oriented findings, and 20 qualitative studies. Farmer field schools improve farmers' knowledge and adoption of beneficial practices, and reduce overuse of pesticides. This leads to positive outcomes for farmers: on average, a 13% increase in agricultural yields and a 20% increase in income. Farmer field schools also reduce pesticide use and environmental degradation. However, the evidence for these outcomes comes from short‐term evaluations of pilot programmes, and no studies with a low risk of bias are available. In programmes that were delivered at a national scale, studies conducted more than two years after implementation did not show any positive outcomes from the programme. For large‐scale programmes, recruiting and training appropriate facilitators was problematic. Authors' conclusions Farmer field schools (FFS) are a common approach used to transfer specialist knowledge, promote skills and empower farmers around the world. At least 10 million farmers in 90 countries have attended such schools. FFS are implemented by facilitators using participatory “discovery‐based” learning based on adult education principles. Many different implementing bodies have been involved. Field schools have a range of objectives, including tackling overuse of pesticides and other harmful practices, improving agricultural and environmental outcomes, and empowering disadvantaged farmers such as women. We conducted a systematic review of evidence on FFS implementation to investigate whether FFS make a difference, to which farmers, and why or why not. We synthesised quantitative evidence on intervention effects using statistical meta‐analysis, and qualitative evidence on the barriers and enablers of effectiveness using a theory of change framework. The results of statistical meta‐analysis provide evidence that FFS are beneficial in improving intermediate outcomes relating to knowledge learned and adoption of beneficial practices, as well as final outcomes relating to agricultural production and farmers' incomes. The findings suggest this to be the case for FFS promoting integrated pest management (IPM) technology, as well as other techniques. However, the rigorous impact evaluation evidence base is small and there are no studies that we were able to identify as having a low risk of bias. There is no evidence that neighbouring non‐participant farmers benefit from diffusion of IPM knowledge from FFS participants. Therefore, they do not experience improvements in IPM adoption and agriculture outcomes. The evidence of positive effects on agricultural outcomes is largely limited to short‐term evaluations of pilot programmes. In the few examples where FFS have been scaled up, the evidence does not suggest they have been effective in improving agricultural outcomes among participating farmers or neighbouring non‐participants. Although empowerment is a major objective of many FFS, very few studies have collected information on this outcome in a rigorous manner. A few studies suggest farmers feel greater self‐confidence. What explains the lack of scalable effects among FFS participants, or diffusion of IPM practices among the community? FFS differ from standard agricultural extension interventions, which tend to focus on disseminating knowledge of more simple practices such as application of fertiliser and pesticides, or adoption of improved seeds. The experiential nature of the training, and the need for the benefits of the FFS technology to be observed, are barriers to spontaneous diffusion. Furthermore, the effectiveness of scaled‐up interventions has been hampered by problems in recruiting and training appropriate facilitators at scale. The review provides implications for policy, practice and research. Executive Summary BACKGROUND After almost three decades of decline in public support, agriculture is now back on the development agenda. Since the late 1980s, support to agriculture has shifted from top‐down approaches to those identifying technologies and methods of communicating technologies which are suitable to support farmers' livelihoods in a sustainable manner, including participatory approaches based on the notion of creating spaces for farmer self‐learning. One such approach is the farmer field school (FFS), an adult education intervention which uses intensive “discovery‐based” learning methods with the objectives of providing skills in such areas as integrated pest management (IPM) and empowering farmers and communities. FFS have been implemented in 90 countries worldwide, reaching an estimated 10‐15 million farmers. Farmer field schools may appear to be the latest tool, but what does the evidence say regarding their effectiveness? OBJECTIVES This systematic review synthesises evidence on interventions identified as “farmer field schools” conducted in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The review aims to provide answers to the following research questions: Review question (1): What are the effects of farmer field schools on final outcomes such as yields, net revenues and farmer empowerment? What are the effects of farmer field schools on intermediate outcomes such as knowledge and adoption of improved practices (e.g. reduced use of pesticides)? What are the effects on outcomes for non‐participating neighbouring farmers living in the same communities as FFS farmers? Review question (2): What are the enablers of and barriers to FFS effectiveness, diffusion and sustainability? STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA Studies included in the review satisfied the following criteria. Eligible participants included farmers growing arable crops, living in low‐ or middle‐income countries at the time of the intervention. The review included those participating directly in the field school and also non‐participant neighbour farmers who may benefit through spillover effects or more formal dissemination methods. Eligible interventions were those identified as “farmer field schools,” regardless of the design or implementation, including FFS programmes providing training in IPM and other techniques. Studies combining FFS with other intervention components, such as input or marketing support, were also included. Comparisons eligible for the effectiveness review were farmers who received no intervention, or access to agricultural extension services from another source, including IPM (or equivalent) training. All outcomes reported were eligible for the review.primary Primary outcomes were agricultural outcomes, including yields and profits (net revenues). Secondary outcomes included other final outcomes such as environmental outcomes, health status and empowerment; and intermediate outcomes, including farmer knowledge and adoption of practices. Qualitative evidence on barriers to and enablers of effectiveness and sustainability were also included, including process and implementation information and measures of beneficiaries' attitudes and experiences with FFS. Eligible study designs for the effectiveness synthesis (review question 1) were measurable using counterfactual impact evaluations, including experimental or quasi‐experimental study designs and methods of analysis. Studies eligible for the synthesis of barriers and enablers (review question 2) were based on primary data collected from FFS participants, extension agents or experts, analysed using qualitative methods or descriptive statistics. The qualitative studies needed to report at least some information on the research question, procedures for collecting data, sampling and recruitment, and at least two sample characteristics. SEARCH STRATEGY The search included electronic academic databases, internet search engines, websites and theses, as well as handsearches of key journals and literature snowballing. Searches included general social science sources as well as agriculture subject‐specific sources of published and unpublished literature. All searches were updated in October 2012. The farmer field schools evaluation community has generated a large number of evaluations. We screened the titles and abstracts of over 28,000 papers, the majority of which were irrelevant to the topic. Four‐hundred‐sixty (460) relevant papers on FFS were assessed for inclusion based on full text. After the final screen by two authors, 134 quasi‐experimental studies comprising 92 distinct evaluations meeting the inclusion criteria were eligible for the review. The impact evaluations provide quantitative estimates of effects on outcomes for 71 FFS projects. However, only 15 of the impact evaluations meeting the inclusion criteria were judged to be of sufficient internal validity to make predictions for policy. The review also includes 20 qualitative evaluations meeting the inclusion criteria, which discuss the barriers to and enablers of change in 20 FFS projects. A portfolio review of 337 project documents was also conducted. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two independent reviewers assessed the full text papers against the inclusion criteria; discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by a third author if needed. Two reviewers extracted data from included studies. Quantitative impact evaluation studies were critically appraised according to the likely risk of bias according to threats to internal validity (causal identification), external validity (generalisability) and file‐drawer effects (publication bias). Qualitative evaluations were assessed according to adequacy of reporting, data collection, presentation, analysis and conclusions drawn. We used a hypothesised programme theory of change (White, 2009) as the framework for integrating the evidence. We collected data on programme design, implementation, targeting and contextual factors, and linked individual studies by programme in order to assess whether heterogeneous programme effects were correlated with study design, implementation and context. For the quantitative synthesis (review question 1), we extracted effect size estimates from included studies, calculating standard errors and 95 per cent confidence intervals using data provided in the studies, where possible. We used random effects meta‐analysis, estimating average effects of farmer field schools on the different outcomes, and examining heterogeneity. The results of the publication bias analysis suggested under‐reporting of small sample studies with negative or insignificant findings for studies reporting evidence on agricultural yields, which is evidence for possible publication bias. For the synthesis of qualitative evidence (review question 2), we used a thematic approach (Thomas &amp; Harden, 2008), combining predetermined themes based on the links and assumptions in the theory of change model, as well as any other themes emerging from the detailed coding of the included studies. In the final stage of analysis, we used an iterated approach in which some effect moderators identified during the qualitative synthesis were tested in meta‐analysis and meta‐regression. RESULTS Review question (1) No studies with a low risk of bias were identified for the review of effects and only 15 (out of 92) quasi‐experimental studies were assessed as being of medium risk of bias and therefore policy‐actionable. The results of these medium‐risk‐of‐bias studies (reported in Summary of Findings Table 1) suggest farmer field schools impact positively on intermediate and final outcomes for participating farmers in the short to medium term. Findings for intermediate outcomes were as follows: There was a significant increase of 0.21 standard deviations on knowledge about beneficial practices among farmer field school participants over comparison farmers (SMD=0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.07, 0.35; Q=5, Tau‐sq=0.008, I‐sq=55%; evidence from 3 studies). There was a significant reduction in pesticide use by 23 per cent for IPM and IPPM FFS participants over comparison farmers (RR=0.77, 95% CI=0.61, 0.97; Q=40, Tau‐sq=0.07, I‐sq=83%; 8 studies). Effects on pesticide use were particularly large and consistent for cotton IPM projects in Asia. There was a significant increase in indices of adoption of other beneficial practices by 0.22 standard deviations over comparison farmers (SMD=0.22, 95% CI=0.06, 0.38; Q=10, Tau‐sq=0.02, I‐sq=80%; 3 studies). For final outcomes, the findings were as follows: A significant increase in agricultural yields was estimated among FFS participants, by 13 per cent over comparison farmers (RR=1.13, 95% CI=1.04, 1.22; Q=53, Tau‐sq=0.008, I‐sq=81%; 11 studies). A significant increase in profits (net revenues) was estimated, by 19 per cent among FFS participants over comparison farmers (RR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11, 1.27; Q=1, Tau‐sq=0, I‐sq=0%; 2 studies). The increase in profits was higher for FFS projects which also included complementary interventions involving input or marketing support (RR=2.51, 95% CI=1.51, 4.16, Q=1, Tau‐sq=0, I‐sq=0%; 2 studies). There was a 39 per cent reduction in estimated environmental impact quotient (EIQ) score as a result of reduced pesticide use among FFS farmers over comparison farmers (RR=0.61, 95% CI=0.48, 0.78; Q=3, Tau‐sq=0.01, I‐sq=33%; 3 studies). We could not identify any studies which provided valid estimates of impacts on farmer health outcomes . Very few studies assessed empowerment using quantitative counterfactual methods, and only one provided estimates of statistical precision. However, there is no evidence of effects on outcomes over the longer term (follow‐up surveys greater than two years after implementation) in programmes which have been scaled up nationwide. For IPM farmer field schools, there is no evidence that diffusion from FFS participants to non‐participating neighbour farmers usually happens: Overall, studies found no significant change in knowledge among FFS neighbours over comparison farmers. There was also no evidence for improvements among neighbours on pesticide use, yields or environmental impact quotient. When relatively better‐educated farmers are targeted to participate in the IPM field schools, diffusion may occur for simple practices (such as reduced pesticide use) and yields. However, even in a few cases where diffusion appeared to occur, the evidence does not suggest diffusion to non‐participants is sustained over time. Review question (2) Qualitative evaluations (reported in Summary of Findings Table 2) in the review helped us to understand the different types of farmer field schools implemented around the world, the reasons for heterogeneous impacts among FFS participants, and the limited diffusion to non‐participating neighbour farmers. FFS use discovery‐based learning methods which differ from agricultural extension interventions that tend to focus on disseminating knowledge of more simple practices, for instance application of fertiliser and pesticides, or adoption of improved seeds. However, there are several barriers to spontaneous diffusion of knowledge and practices. The FFS curriculum is complex and the training should be experience‐based, so that farmers are able to observe that FFS practices have a relative advantage over conventional farmer practices. Existing levels of social capital, the reach of social networks, and approaches to targeting FFS participants were found to be potentially important factors in influencing diffusion. More generally, the studies identify some of the more common problems in implementation, notably where a top‐down “transfer of technology” approach has been implemented for an intervention which is intended to be based on a “bottom‐up” participatory approach. All qualitative evaluations presented some evidence of use of triangulation to verify their findings, although most studies had weaknesses in reporting on sampling, analysis, and presentation of data, making quality appraisal of this evidence base challenging. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PROGRAMMES Farmer field schools can have beneficial effects for participating farmers, in pilot programmes in the short term. The impacts on agricultural outcomes may be of substantial importance to farmers, in the region of a 10 per cent increase in yields and 20 per cent increase in profits (net revenues). The effects are particularly large when FFS are implemented alongside complementary upstream or downstream interventions (access to seeds and other inputs, assistance in marketing produce) for cash crops. However, the few studies of scaled‐up programmes measuring outcomes over the longer term (more than two years post‐training) do not find any evidence of effects of FFS. Farmers may also feel more confident, but again very few studies have assessed empowerment outcomes rigorously. There is little evidence of diffusion of improved practices or outcomes from FFS participants to non‐participating neighbour farmers. Field schools targeting more educated farmers may be better able to diffuse simple practices, such as on reduced pesticide use, than field schools that target less educated farmers. However, there is no evidence that any diffusion of practices is sustained over time, nor any evidence for adoption of more complex IPM practices via diffusion. As a method of rural adult education, FFS appear suited for gradual scale‐up provided there is a clear focus on ensuring local institutionalisation (i.e. favouring intensiveness of coverage in each community over geographical breadth of coverage). On the other hand, FFS seem unsuited to solve the problems of large‐scale extension. The approach may not be cost‐effective compared with agricultural extension in many contexts, except where existing farming practices are particularly damaging, for example due to overuse of pesticides. This is because of the highly intensive (and therefore relatively costly) nature of the training programme, the relative successes in targeting more educated farmers as compared with disadvantaged groups, and failures in promoting diffusion of IPM practices. Targeting FFS participants: Proponents of FFS have recommended targeting more highly educated farmers, those with greater land endowments, younger farmers and women, favouring those with relatively low opportunity costs of labour or farmers with relatively high pesticide costs. Problems were highlighted in targeting women who lived in household where they were not in a decision‐making position, and youth who were unable to dedicate sufficient time to the FFS plot or their fields. Where the aim is to include women and disadvantaged members of the community, implementers may need to tailor the intervention to enable their participation in the programme. The curriculum needs to be relevant and consistent with the needs and opportunities of women and the poor. Most obviously, in contexts where women are primarily responsible for growing subsistence crops, a curriculum that covers only commercial crops is unlikely to attract women participants. More generally, the curriculum and crops covered in FFS should also be adapted according to the local agricultural system and the needs of the farmers targeted by the programme. Curricula need to deal with the major challenges facing farmers. In most cases, these challenges will be multifaceted, highlighting the need to balance comprehensiveness with being able to cover all issues in sufficient depth to ensure appropriate learning. A cumulative approach over several seasons, including exchanges between field schools, may be preferable. FFS facilitators: The evidence also suggests that appropriate targeting and training of FFS facilitators is important. The theory of change suggests FFS should be delivered according to a participatory and discovery‐based approach to learning, including opportunities for farmers to experiment and observe new practices, particularly if farmers are to be empowered with lifelong skills capacity development. Attempts to target facilitators based on education or literacy levels may be less effective than targeting based on ability to communicate, and appropriate training which enables facilitators to use a bottom‐up approach. This is most obviously a barrier in scaled‐up programmes where FFS facilitators are recruited from extension staff who previously used more top‐down agricultural extension methods. Recruitment of facilitators should take into account personal attitude, maturity, literacy, leadership skills, knowledge in local language and experience with farming. In many contexts the gender of the facilitator should be carefully considered. Facilitators should have access to ongoing support and backstopping from supervisors and technical experts connected to local research centres. Regular monitoring of facilitators may help to identify schools where additional support is required. Complementary policies: Institutional actors involved in FFS should consider farmers' needs and interests in the design and implementation of the FFS programme. In some contexts stronger policies and regulatory measures may be necessary to counteract the activities of the pesticide industry, including the promotion and sale of pesticides by extension workers who are promoting FFS. New policies facilitating participatory agricultural extension approaches, replacing earlier extension policies aimed at promoting off‐the‐shelf technologies and input packages, may also be necessary. Local institutionalisation: Formal support and encouragement of FFS alumni, including technical assistance and backstopping, may be important for the sustainability of FFS practices and related activities. Given the skills‐based nature of the practices promoted in FFS, formal community‐building activities, support and successful attempts to institutionalise the approach, to encourage FFS graduates to train other farmers, are likely to be needed for any broader diffusion to non‐participating neighbour farmers, although the evidence base does not indicate that such attempts have been successful in the past. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH The majority of FFS impact evaluations (68 out of 92) use designs of questionable internal validity, and are therefore of limited value in determining whether farmer field schools have made a difference to outcomes. We were not able to locate any completed evaluations which used randomised assignment, an approach which is feasible for FFS. In three‐quarters of evaluations, no serious attempts were made to control for confounding through statistical matching or other statistical analysis, and in one‐third of cases statistical significance tests were not reported. The likely consequence, as indicated in the meta‐analysis, was the systematic overestimation of effects for all outcomes. The extent of resources that has been devoted to farmer field schools evaluations might therefore be usefully re‐allocated to conducting fewer but more rigorous impact evaluations, particularly those based on a solid counterfactual, with prospective cluster‐level assignment (randomised or otherwise) to allow measurement of community‐wide diffusion and to assess effects on agriculture and empowerment outcomes in the medium to longer term (three years or more). Evaluations should report information on both intervention design and implementation processes so that it is possible to assess whether programme causal chains break down because the intervention design is simply not appropriate for the context or because of poor implementation. Many qualitative evaluations need to report aspects of the research process in greater detail to allow users to assess their credibility and applicability. In particular, clear reporting on objectives, on methods of sampling, data collection and analysis should be provided. Greater use of structured abstracts will facilitate easier access to quantitative and especially qualitative research. Future studies should include data on views and experiences of FFS facilitators and agricultural extension workers.

This paper explores how pre‐registration engagement with a university Facebook network influences students’ post‐registration social networks. Research was conducted with first year undergraduates at a British university using an online survey. Students reported that they specifically joined Facebook pre‐registration as a means of making new friends at university, as well as keeping in touch with friends and family at home. The survey data also illustrate that once at university, Facebook was part of the ‘social glue’ that helped students settle into university life. However, care must be taken not to over‐privilege Facebook: it is clearly only one aspect of students’ more general social networking practices and face‐to‐face interrelationships and interactions remain important. Students thought Facebook was used most importantly for social reasons, not for formal teaching purposes, although it was sometimes used informally for learning purposes.'},\n",

The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task’s perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms’ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants.

       "  'abstract': 'Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity, and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present pilot experiments with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. Our inhouse commercial hotel marketing platform, eXclusivi, was extended with a new software module working with ChatGPT prompts and persuasive ads created for its recommendations. In particular, we developed an intelligent advertisement (ad) copy generation tool for the hotel marketing platform. The proposed approach allows for the hotel team to target all guests in their language, leveraging the integration with the hotel’s reservation system. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between ChatGPT and persuasive technology in recommender systems, ultimately influencing guest satisfaction and hotel revenue.'},\n",

The proposed method accounts for not only preference heterogeneity across users but also unobserved product heterogeneity by introducing the interaction of unobserved product attributes with customer characteristics. The authors describe estimation by means of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and use the model with a large data set to recommend movies either when collaborative filtering methods are viable alternatives or when no recommendations can be made by these methods.\"},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Abstract Market segmentation is an established technique in commercial marketing. It can be used by archivists and records managers to help them gain a wider understanding of their users. Segmentation can be based on demographic criteria, or other models can be employed that are more specific to studies of the use and users of records. Segmentation can be used to good effect in design and evaluation of user-focused systems. Standards for segmentation would be beneficial but their development will not be a simple task. Notes Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users’ Sexton et al., ‘User Feedback’. The LEADERS project, available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/leaders-project/ (accessed 6 January 2005), sought to develop innovative tools for delivering archives to users, linking Encoded Archival Description (EAD) finding aids to Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) transcripts and digital images of archival materials. The author is indebted to Elizabeth Hallam Smith, Susan Hockey, Anna Sexton and Elizabeth Shepherd for their contributions to early drafts of this article. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records. Hedstrom, ‘How do Archivists Make Electronic Archives Usable and Accessible?,’ 12. Tibbo, ‘Primarily History,’ 1. Prom, ‘The EAD Cookbook,’ 266. The same theme recurs in Gilliland-Swetland, ‘An Exploration of K-12 User Needs for Digital Primary Source Materials,’ 143; Duff, ‘Understanding the Information-seeking Behaviour of Archival Researchers in a Digital Age,’ 332; Yakel, ‘Impact of Internet-based Discovery Tools on Use and Users of Archives,’ 199. All these authors reiterate calls to action made in the 1980s, for example by Freeman, ‘In the Eye of the Beholder’; Conway, ‘Facts and Frameworks’; Dowler, ‘The Role of Use in Defining Archival Practice and Principles’. Since the 1980s much work on user access has been done, but many aspects remain unexplored. Prom, User Interactions with Electronic Finding Aids in a Controlled Setting. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 82 – 87, 113. Ibid., 155 – 62. The employment of systematic user studies as a benchmark for appraisal and archival acquisition was suggested by Dowler, ‘The Role of Use,’ 75; but the recent emphasis on functional and macro appraisal has militated against this approach, and proposals to focus on users and use have been attacked, notably by Cook, ‘Viewing the World Upside Down,’ 123 – 34. See, however, Eastwood, ‘Towards a Social Theory of Appraisal’, and the remarks of Horsman, ‘Appraisal on Wooden Shoes,’ 41, on the decision to revise the Dutch PIVOT macro-appraisal methodology following users' objections that the original methodology did not take their needs into account. The arguments against excluding considerations of use from appraisal decisions were cogently stated by Greene, ‘The Surest Proof’. Greene acknowledged the limitations of utilitarian criteria, particularly the impossibility of measuring future rather than past or present use, but also emphasised the futility of preserving records that are not in some way useful. The UK National Archives now seeks comments from user groups on all its ‘operational selection policies’ governing selection of records for long-term preservation. See Twigge, ‘Public Records, Public Consultation’. As noted by Cook, ‘Viewing the World Upside Down,’ endnote 7, ignoring indirect users leads to an underestimation of the impact of archives and records services. The perspectives of indirect users are particularly relevant to appraisal decisions; arguably they may be less important in design or evaluation of access systems. McDonald and Dunbar, Market Segmentation, 10. Most marketing textbooks provide descriptions of market segmentation from a commercial viewpoint. See, for example, Kotler et al., Principles of Marketing, chap. 9. Hallam Smith, ‘Customer Focus and Marketing in Archive Service Delivery,’ 36. Rowley, ‘From Users to Customers?,’ 160. Such opportunities are discussed further in Digicult, New Technologies for the Cultural and Scientific Heritage Sector, 21 – 38. LEADERS undertook some exploration of this dimension of EAD. See also Ashley, ‘Interworking Technologies’. Rowley, ‘From Users to Customers?,’ 160. Ibid., 160. http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives/psqg/ (accessed 6 January 2005).

Hawkins et al., ‘Socio-economic Features of UK Public Library Users,’ 262. For an example of the latter approach see Keng, Jung, and Wirtz, ‘Segmentation of Library Visitors in Singapore,’ 24. A scale of 1 – 5 is sometimes called a ‘Likert’ scale, although strictly speaking this name applies only to scales used to measure agreement with assertions. More complex scales for measuring computer literacy have also been developed. See Bunz, The Computer-Email-Web Fluency Scale. The studies examined were Buttler, ‘The Results of a Survey of Visitors to Warwickshire County Record Office,’ 178; Cherry and Duff, Improving Access to Early Canadiana, 11; Zhang, ‘Scholarly Use of Internet-based Electronic Resources,’ 749; Marcella and Baxter, ‘Information Need, Information Seeking Behaviour and Participation, with Special Reference to Needs Related to Citizenship,’ 139; PSQG surveys 2001 and 2002, available from http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives/psqg/survey.htm (accessed 6 January 2005); A2A user analysis, 2002, available from http://www.a2a.org.uk/stats/NewUserStats.htm (accessed 6 January 2005); Keng et al., ‘Segmentation of Library Visitors in Singapore,’ 23. More encouragingly, many of the questions asked in the recent Archives Awareness Month evaluation were framed to provide data directly comparable with the 2002 PSQG survey: National Council on Archives, Archives Awareness Month, 34. Available from http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/ (accessed 6 January 2005). Available from http://www.ulcc.ac.uk/unesco/; http://www.ukat.org.uk/ (both accessed 6 January 2005). A mapping of SOC 2000 to the European variant of ISCO 88 is available. See http://www.statistics.gov.uk/nsbase/methods_quality/ns_sec/soc2000.asp (accessed 6 January 2005). None of the classification schemes include students, retired people or the unemployed; in a user study, supplementary categories are likely to be required. Marcella and Baxter, ‘Information Need, Information Seeking Behaviour and Participation, with Special Reference to Needs Related to Citizenship’; Hawkins, Morris, and Sumsion, ‘Socio-economic Features of UK Public Library Users’; MORI, Visitors to Museums and Galleries in the UK. This has replaced the Social Class (SC) and Socio-economic Group (SEG) classifications formerly used by the Office of the Registrar General. For advice on selecting formats see Black, Doing Quantitative Research in the Social Sciences, 306 – 29. As, for example, in Sexton et al., ‘User Feedback,’ Appendix. For an analysis of the extensive literature from these fields see Case, Looking for Information. Williams, ‘Data Collection and Management in the Archival Domain,’ 66. In many organisations data about internal use may be considered more sensitive or less suited to external dissemination. Moreover, in the UK much of the work has been driven by the Government's agenda for archives; there has not been the same pressure for publicly accessible measures of records management outcomes. See, for example, Roper, ‘The Academic Use of Archives’; Beattie, ‘An Archival User Study’; Orbach, ‘The View from the Researcher's Desk: Historians' Perceptions of Research and Repositories’; Duff and Johnson, ‘Accidentally Found on Purpose,’ 472 – 96; Tibbo, ‘Primarily History in America’. Similar studies from outside the archival domain are cited by Tibbo, ‘Primarily History’. Not all employ segmentation techniques, but many do. The author knows of very few user studies in records management. The most thoughtful of the three or four user-focused articles published in the Records Management Journal is Day, ‘Why Are We Here?’; see also Chown, ‘Establishing a Profile of the Users of a Records Management System’. Few studies of archive users recognise use by organisational staff and records creators. A notable exception is Yakel and Bost, ‘Understanding Administrative Use and Users in University Archives’. Variations on this dichotomy were proposed by Kotler and Andreasen, Strategic Marketing for Nonprofit Organizations, 170 – 71 (non-users, former/lapsed users, first-time/occasional users, regular/established users) and Sabin and Samuels, Towards a Better Understanding of Non-users (indifferent, outsiders, latent supporters, personal questers, advocates). Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 155 – 56. AS 4390.1-1996, Records Management. Pt 1, General. Sec 8.1 See also National Archives of Australia, Why Records are Kept. This article is not the place to summarise, or add to, the debate on whether there are reasons for record-keeping unconnected with the records' actual or potential use. The arguments are summarised in Greene, ‘The Surest Proof,’ 142 – 45. It suffices to note that the model presented here shows a user focus, in contrast to the supplier focus sometimes apparent in the Australian discourse. One possible answer is that the community expects organisations to be accountable, but in the Australian model accountability apparently does not form part of ‘community expectations’. The meaning of ‘accountability’ is widely discussed in the professional literature, but there is little discussion of what is meant by ‘business purposes’ or ‘business use’. Many writers apparently believe that the meaning of ‘business purposes’ is self-evident; in practice this means that its boundaries are undefined. The term has often been interpreted to mean only the business of individual record creators or the organisation that employs them; but when records are more widely accessible they can be also used to support the business of other organisations or individuals, even to the detriment of the organisation or individual with whom they originated. The definition of ‘business purposes’ presented here does not differentiate between users, but focuses on use. Users are categorised separately. For the growing literature on accountability see, for example, McKemmish, The Smoking Gun; Meijer, ‘Anticipating Accountability Processes’; Solomon and Solomon, Corporate Governance and Accountability. Cultural use should not be equated with research, since research can be undertaken for business as well as cultural purposes. Academic research is a type of cultural use; however, cultural use is not limited to academics or any other category of users. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 156 – 57. Evidence can be defined as ‘ground for belief’ in the truth or validity of something needing proof: Phelan and Reynolds, Argument and Evidence, 99. Records provide evidence not only in courts of law but in any situation requiring confirmation that something was done or that it was done correctly. This definition is doubtless over-simplified. Information science literature provides many discussions of the complex meanings of ‘information’, together with many typologies of information use. Attempts have been made to relate some of these to the use of records (see e.g. Yakel, ‘Thinking Inside and Outside the Boxes,’ 146), but these are not always wholly convincing. The word ‘associations’ is used by museum curators to refer to the value of objects arising from their previous use or their connection with a particular occasion. Some records are valued for sentimental or symbolic reasons because of their association with an individual, organisation, place or event; see O'Toole, ‘The Symbolic Significance of Archives’. Schellenberg, Modern Archives, 139 – 60. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 148 – 51, 156 – 57. The nuances of the word ‘evidence’ are only beginning to be explored in archival literature. To some archivists, ‘evidence’ is what records are; ‘information’ is something that they contain, or can be derived from studying them. For a contrasting view, see Brothman, ‘Afterglow’. Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 156. Ibid., 156 – 61. Ibid., 157 – 60. A similar approach could be used to collate other variables, such as materials used and intensity of use by different groups. The charting methods discussed earlier in this article could also be employed. The figures do not depict research findings, but reflect the experience of the author and his colleagues in organisations which create records or have custody of records created by others. In an organisational context, records created by one member of a team or workgroup may also be used by other members of the team. However, it may be surmised that patterns of use will differ little between team members and creators. In Table 3 they are treated as a single group. See, for example, Rowley's suggested categories: general public; professionals; academic users; business users; ‘information intermediaries’ such as agents and consultants (Rowley, ‘From Users to Customers?,’ 158). The first PSQG surveys asked users to choose from: personal interest; professional researcher; media research; business or public body; academic staff; research degree; taught degree/further education; adult education; school staff; school student (Ailes and Watt, ‘Survey of Visitors,’ 188). In 2002 the list was changed to: personal leisure; non-leisure personal or family business; education as student/researcher; education as teacher; connection with employment. A PSQG report acknowledged that this list still has overlaps (PSQG Performance Indicators Working Party, Towards Generic and Universal PIs for Archives, 6). Some studies, including the PSQG surveys in 1999 and 2001, have resorted to including a category of ‘other’ users. Freeman, ‘In the Eye of the Beholder,’ 117, noted this as a convenient but meaningless solution. See also Blais and Enns, ‘From Paper Archives to People Archives,’ 112, endnote 31. Buttler, ‘The Results of a Survey,’ 176. Arguably what underlies the confusion is an assumption that cultural use and external use of archives are co-extensive, and do not require separate measures. The same assumption underlies Schellenberg's appraisal model (Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 151). However, as already noted, external use is not exclusively cultural, and vice versa. Methven et al., Measuring Performance, 30. An alternative taxonomy, proposed in Conway, Partners in Research, 50 – 51, separates academic from other occupational users, on the grounds that research undertaken by academics has a broader scope. Although it may often be broader, it is not necessarily so. Available from http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/ (accessed 6 January 2005). Borgman, ‘All Users of Information Retrieval Systems are Not Created Equal,’ 238. History is discussed here merely as an example. Similar considerations apply to other disciplines. Although all users of records are using historical sources (in the sense that the records were created in the past), not all use records to study history: see Gilliland-Swetland, ‘An Exploration of K-12 User Needs,’ 144. Case, ‘The Collection and Use of Information by Some American Historians,’ 67. Thesaurus construction is more usually encountered in the context of providing subject access points for descriptions of holdings, but the issues are the same when segmenting users' areas of study. A brief summary, emphasising the different relational structures of whole/part, genus/species and type/instance, is in Shepherd and Yeo, Managing Records, 234 – 36. For more detailed advice see Aitchison, Gilchrist, and Bawden, Thesaurus Construction and Use. As the Churchill example shows, the more topics that are combined, the more specific the area of study. A specificity measure should also take account of the broadness or narrowness of each topic concerned. Political leaders (broad topic) and the Second World War (broad topic) is much less specific than Churchill (narrow topic) and D-Day (narrow topic). How one measures the relative specificity of Political leaders and D-Day and Churchill and the Second World War remains unclear. Kiestra, Stokmans, and Kamphuis, ‘End-users Searching the Online Catalogue’. Kelly and Cool, ‘The Effects of Topic Familiarity on Information Search Behavior’. LEADERS assessed this as ‘familiarity with research interest’: Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users,’ 44 – 45. For example, knowledge of library systems, which may generate false expectations about the nature of records or finding-aids: Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users,’ 45. PSQG Surveys of Visitors to British Archives 1999 – 2002, available from http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/archives/psqg/survey.htm (accessed 6 January 2005); Zhang, ‘Scholarly Use of Internet-based Electronic Resources,’ 751 – 52. Dowler, ‘The Role of Use,’ 79. Blais and Enns, ‘From Paper Archives to People Archives,’ 109. Bearman, ‘User Presentation Language in Archives’; Gagnon-Arguin, ‘Les questions de recherche comme matériau d'études des usagers’; Martin, ‘An Analysis of Remote Reference Correspondence at a Large Academic Manuscripts Collection’; Duff and Johnson, ‘A Virtual Expression of Need’. A possible taxonomy of research stages, adapted from Chu, ‘Literary Critics at Work and Their Information Needs’, is ‘idea generation, preparation, elaboration, analysis, writing, dissemination’; but this model presupposes academic research and is probably less applicable to other types of investigative work. White, ‘The Communications Behavior of Academic Economists in Research Phases’, offered a three-stage model (problem definition, data collection, interpretation) which may be applicable more generally, and broadly similar models were suggested by Bearman and Trant, Unifying Our Cultural Memory and Sarantakos, Social Research, 276. Many writers have noted that research is not necessarily a linear process. See for example Miller and Tegler, ‘Online Searching and the Research Process’. Preliminary findings on user behaviour at certain phases of research in archives were reported by Dowler, ‘The Role of Use,’ 79, and more extensively by Duff and Johnson, ‘Accidentally Found on Purpose,’ 480 – 95. Ellis, ‘A Behavioural Approach to Information Retrieval Design’. Ross, ‘Position Paper on Integrity and Authenticity of Digital Cultural Heritage Objects’. In 2003 a PSQG report left unresolved the question of ‘whether it is possible to identify broad generic categories of material consulted by users’ (PSQG Performance Indicators Working Party, Towards Generic and Universal PIs, 11). Various models are available: Jenkinson, A Manual of Archive Administration, 192 – 93 categorised ‘English archives’ as public, semi-public, private, ecclesiastical or artificial; Procter and Cook, Manual of Archival Description, 13 – 14 proposed the concept of ‘management groups’ for categorising archival holdings. There is scope for assessing how far such classifications are appropriate for user studies. The main obstacle to random sampling is often the difficulty of obtaining the ‘sampling frame’, the list of all members of the group from which the sample is taken. The principles and some practical problems of all three methods were described by Maxwell-Stewart, Sheppard, and Yeo, Hospital Patient Case Records, 16 – 21 in the context of selecting records for preservation; broadly similar issues arise when employing these techniques in user studies. For a fuller explanation see Sarantakos, Social Research, 139 – 64. Covey, Usage and Usability Assessment, sec. 4.2.1. Sexton et al., ‘Understanding Users,’ 38 – 42; Sexton et al., ‘User Feedback,’ 191. In 2003 the Cultural Content Forum analysed 94 user profiles, mostly from museums but including some from archival institutions. None used a model recommended in a published source or based on previous research (Cultural Content Forum, Evaluation of Digital Cultural Content, 9). PSQG Performance Indicators Working Party, Towards Generic and Universal Pis, 1. Cultural Content Forum, Evaluation of Digital Cultural Content, 19.\"},\n",

This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.'},\n",

Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.'},\n",

At the marketing research stage, mechanical AI can be used for data collection, thinking AI for market analysis, and feeling AI for customer understanding. At the marketing strategy (STP) stage, mechanical AI can be used for segmentation (segment recognition), thinking AI for targeting (segment recommendation), and feeling AI for positioning (segment resonance). At the marketing action stage, mechanical AI can be used for standardization, thinking AI for personalization, and feeling AI for relationalization.

The findings indicate that perceived ease of use is a dominant factor in explaining perceived usefulness and system usage, and that perceived usefulness has a strong effect on system usage. The results also indicate that exogenous variables influence both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, particularly management support and external support.
