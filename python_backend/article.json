Ailawadi","Harald J. van Heerde"],"abstract":"Brand equity is the differential preference and response to marketing effort that a product obtains because of its brand identification. Brand equity can be measured using either consumer perceptions or sales. Consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) measures what consumers think and feel about the brand, whereas sales-based brand equity (SBBE) is the brand intercept in a choice or market share model. This article studies the extent to which CBBE manifests itself in SBBE and marketing-mix response using ten years of IRI scanner and Brand Asset Valuator data for 290 brands spanning 25 packaged good categories. The authors uncover a fairly strong positive association of SBBE with three dimensions of CBBE—relevance, esteem, and knowledge—but a slight negative correspondence with the fourth dimension, energized differentiation. They also reveal new insights on the category characteristics that moderate the CBBE–SBBE relationship and document a more nuanced association of the CBBE dimensions with response to the major marketing-mix variables than heretofore assumed. The authors discuss implications for academic researchers who predict and test the impact of brand equity, for market researchers who measure it, and for marketers who want to translate their brand equity into marketplace success."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.17358/jma.18.3.240","publication_year":2021,"title":"Marketing Mix, Brand Equity, and Purchase Decisions of Packaged Rice Products","cited_by_count":10,"authors":["Mochammad Reza Firmansyah","Ujang Sumarwan","Muhammad Mukti Ali"],"abstract":"In selling packaged rice products, Perum BULOG needs to implement the right marketing strategy in order to increase the buying interest of prospective consumers.

Towards the same, the Brand Equity Creation Model developed by Yoo, Donthu and Lee (2000) was expanded and combined with the Brand Choice Model developed by Erdem, et al (1999). The dimensions of brand equity were thought to affect Overall Brand Equity, which in turn affected the final brand choice made by the consumers. The effect that ten selected marketing activities had on the dimensions of brand equity was examined. The passenger car market was differentiated on the basis of the price of car as premium, volume, and economy type and shopping centre intercept survey was conducted to collect respondent data across ten centres throughout the country. Multiple time passenger car buyers were considered as the respondent base for the study. A total of 1,932 consumers were contacted and 302 valid responses were received. Structural Equation Model was used as the tool for analysis. The results showed that: Of the ten marketing mix elements considered, some had a very strong impact on brand equity because they positively impacted both the dimensions considered for the study. However, contrary to what many previous studies reported, country of origin and price promotion did not impact the brand equity for such consumers. Advertising frequency is not a builder of brand equity; word-of-mouth is a better determinant of brand equity for repeat passenger car buyers. The different results obtained in this study vis- à- vis those from earlier studies suggest that the cultural differences between consumers of two countries mediates the effect of the marketing efforts on brand equity creation. Again since each of the dimensions of brand equity under this study was found to positively impact brand choice, it has been posited that the probability of the consumers choosing the final brand is increased with an increase in the equity of the brand. Geographical limitation of the sample and absence of interaction of marketing mix elements amongst themselves were identified as some of the key limitations of the study."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1331677x.2009.11517392","publication_year":2009,"title":"The Effects of Marketing Mix Elements on Service Brand Equity","cited_by_count":24,"authors":["Edo Rajh","Đurđana Ozretić Došen"],"abstract":"This paper explores the effects of selected marketing mix elements on service brand equity.

The outcome of the study can provide meaningful insights into how marketing efforts can be channeled to build brand equity. Three brands-Nike shoes, Nokia high-end phones and Dove soaps-were purposively chosen for this study. Structurai equation modeling was used for analysis. The respondents gave importance to store image (mean = 3.93), advertisement spending (mean = 3.54), and distribution intensity (mean = 3.31) for these relatively luxurious brands with different consumption pattern, indicating that of the three above-said mix elements, distribution intensity is relatively less important. Price deals (mean = 2.88) practiced by these brands are rated as less desirable from the perspective of brand equity. All the concerned brands were rated high in terms of brand awareness (mean = 4.23) and perceived quality (mean = 4.06) harmonious to the marketing mix efforts taken by these brands. However, brand loyalty, a sub-dimension of brand equity, was rated relatively moderately (mean = 3.5), indicating that with many competitive substitutes, brand loyalty is far from reality, whose real influence can be measured better using a longitudinal study.IntroductionA functional product or service that adds value to the customer when backed by creative design around the marketing mix and its execution leads to powerful brands (Kotler and Keller, 2006). Brand Equity (BE) is an outcome of strong planning and long-term investment around successful brands. BE creates points of differentiation from other brands and leads to competitive advantages, which in turn, lead to non-price advantages (Aaker, 1991). In this study an attempt is made to explore the impact of selected marketing mix elements in the creation and sustenance on BE. The outcome of the study can provide meaningful insights into how marketing efforts can be channeled to build BE.Literature ReviewBE creates value for the firm and the customer (Aaker, 1991). It affects stock market behavior (Simon and Sullivan, 1993; and Lane and Jacobson, 1995); affects increased probability of brand choice and ability to command premium prices; and increases marketing communication effectiveness, thereby increasing the sustainability of the brand in the market place (Farquhar et al., 1991; Smith and Park, 1992; Barwise, 1993; Bharadwaj et al., 1993; Keller, 1993; and Simon and Sullivan, 1993).According to Aaker (1991 and 1996), BE is a multidimensional concept consisting of Brand Loyalty (BL), Brand Awareness (BA) and Perceived Quality (PQ). The larger model looks into the effect of selected marketing mix like Store Image (SI), Distribution Intensity (DI), Advertising Spending (AD) and Price Deals (PD) on dimensions like PQ, BL and BA. The brand is fortified and strong equity is an outcome of fine-tuning of the marketing programs (Keller, 1998). In short, for customers high BE is an outcome of having high BA; thereby they perceive the brand to be of high quality and tend to be loyal to the brand (Figure 1).High perceived quality drives a consumer to choose a brand over a competing brand. It is an outcome of long-term interaction with the brand. The customer may feel that the product brand is superior and different from the competing brand. It is otherwise the consumer's judgement about a products' overall superiority (Zeithaml, 1988).Brand loyalty includes the biased behavioral response expressed over time by some decision-making units with respect to one or more alternate brands out of a set of such brands as a function of psychological processes (Jacoby and Kyner, 1973). Brand loyalty is a function of both behavior and attitudes. Repurchase is a sufficient evidence of brand loyalty when the purchasing practice is intentional. Brand loyalty includes some degree of commitment towards the quality of a brand that is a function of both positive attributes and repetitive purchases. …"},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.4172/2223-5833.1000173","publication_year":2015,"title":"The Relationship between Elements of Marketing Mix and Brand Equity","cited_by_count":4,"authors":["Shiva Fathian","Alireza Slambolchi","Kambiz Hamidi"],"abstract":"Today, achieving the stable competitive advantage is one of the most important tools in the business world.

Knowing from this phenomenon, it is known that bakery industry in Indonesia is on the business’s concern recently. The effort in having good brand equity in the consumer’s eyes surely will bring long term profit for the companies that are playing in this industry. In order to have a good brand equity, marketing mix elements which are price, intensity of marketing activities, store image, and price deals are believed can be the effective strategy in the business competition. Moreover, the existence of brand awareness and brand image as mediators are also playing a big role in achieving good brand equity. This market research is conducted by spreading 158 questionnaires to bakery consumers in Surabaya. This data is analyzed using regression with mediating analysis. The result is showing that intensity of marketing activities is not significantly impacting brand equity through brand awareness.

There remains a lack of theory in particular that addresses the measurement of the effectiveness of destination branding over time. The purpose of this paper is to test the effectiveness of a model of consumer‐based brand equity (CBBE) for a country destination. Design/methodology/approach A model of CBBE was adapted from the marketing literature and applied to a nation context. The model was tested by using structural equation modelling with data from a large Chilean sample ( n =845) comprising a mix of previous visitors and non‐visitors. The model fits the data well. Findings The paper reports the results of an investigation into brand equity for Australia as a long‐haul destination in an emerging market. The research took place just before the launch of the nation's fourth new brand campaign in six years. The results indicate Australia is a well‐known but not compelling destination brand for tourists in Chile, which reflects the lower priority the South American market has been given by the national tourism office. Practical implications The paper suggested that CBBE measures could be analysed at various points in time to track any strengthening or weakening of market perceptions in relation to brand objectives. A standard CBBE instrument could provide long‐term effectiveness performance measures regardless of changes in destination marketing organisation staff, advertising agency, other stakeholders and budget.

Naik","Kalyan Raman","Russell S. Winer"],"abstract":"Companies spend millions of dollars on advertising to boost a brand's image and simultaneously spend millions of dollars on promotion that many believe calls attention to price and erodes brand equity. We believe this paradoxical situation exists because both advertising and promotion are necessary to compete effectively in dynamic markets. Consequently, brand managers need to account for interactions between marketing activities and interactions among competing brands. By recognizing interaction effects between activities, managers can consider interactivity trade-offs in planning the marketing-mix strategies. On the other hand, by recognizing interactions with competitors, managers can incorporate strategic foresight in their planning, which requires them to look forward and reason backward in making optimal decisions. Looking forward means that each brand manager anticipates how other competing brands are likely to make future decisions, and then by reasoning backward deduces one's own optimal decisions in response to the best decisions to be made by all other brands. The joint consideration of interaction effects and strategic foresight in planning marketing-mix strategies is a challenging and unsolved marketing problem, which motivates this paper. This paper investigates the problem of planning marketing mix in dynamic competitive markets. We extend the Lanchester model by incorporating interaction effects, constructing the marketing-mix algorithm that yields marketing-mix plans with strategic foresight, and developing the continuous-discrete estimation method to calibrate dynamic models of oligopoly using market data. Both the marketing-mix algorithm and the estimation method are general, so they can be applied to any other alternative model specifications for dynamic oligopoly markets. Thus, this dual methodology augments the decision-making toolkit of managers, empowering them to tackle realistic marketing problems in dynamic oligopoly markets. We illustrate the application of this dual methodology by studying the dynamic Lanchester competition across five brands in the detergents market, where each brand uses advertising and promotion to influence its own market share and the shares of competing brands. Empirically, we find that advertising and promotion not only affect the brand shares (own and competitors') but also exert interaction effects, i.e., each activity amplifies or attenuates the effectiveness of the other activity. Normatively, we find that large brands underadvertise and overspend on promotion, while small brands underadvertise and underpromote. Finally, comparative statics reveal managerial insights into how a specific brand should respond optimally to the changes in a competing brand's situation; more generally, we find evidence that competitive responsiveness is asymmetric."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.14414/jebav.v22i1.1671","publication_year":2019,"title":"The effect of marketing mix and after sales service toward brand equity","cited_by_count":5,"authors":["Roya Bakhshinezhad shamami","Bahram Kheiry"],"abstract":"The present research aimed to study the effect of the marketing mix (price, product, place, promotion) and after-sales services on three dimensions of brand equity (perceived quality, brand loyalty, and brand awareness) using the Aaker Model.

This paper aims to document what those differences have been and provide an integrative framework to guide social marketers in working with significant social and health issues. Design/methodology/approach An integration of views about social marketing is proposed that is focused on the core roles of audience benefits; analysis of behavioral determinants, context and consequences; the use of positioning, brand and personality in marketing strategy development; and use of the four elements of the marketing mix to tailor offerings, realign prices, increase access and opportunities; and communicate these in an evolving media environment. Findings Ideas about branding and positioning, core strategic social marketing concerns, have been better understood and practiced in developing country settings. Social marketing in developing countries has focused much more on products and services, with a concomitant interest in pricing and distribution systems. In developed countries, social marketing has too often taken the 1P route of using persuasive communications for behavior change. The integrative framework calls for an expansion of social marketing to product and service development and delivery, using incentives and other behavioral economic concepts as part of the price element, and extending place as both an access and opportunity idea for behaviors, products and services. Practical implications The framework pulls together social marketing ideas and practices from the diversity of settings in which they have been developed and allows practitioners and academics to use a common set of concepts to think about and design social marketing programs. The model also gives social marketers more latitude in how to use price and place in the design of programs.

The identified e-marketing mix variables will be an insightful aid to planning various marketing activities and controlling other outcome variables like online satisfaction, e-loyalty, online brand equity, etc. This is one of the first attempts to propose and verify e-marketing mix variables for a developing economy like India and classify them under a generic parsimonious dimensional framework for e-commerce."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1108/13522750310470118","publication_year":2003,"title":"Using laddering to understand and leverage a brand’s equity","cited_by_count":104,"authors":["Brian Wansink"],"abstract":"Understanding a brand’s equity is difficult for researchers. Building on means‐end theory, describes a method – laddering – which has proven useful in uncovering insights related to the source and the nature of a brand’s equity. Through laddering interviews, a meaningful “mental map” can be developed that visually links a brand’s attributes, the benefits or consequences of using it, and the personal values it satisfies. An analysis of 1,200 laddering interviews indicates that a combination of only seven basic values are at the core of most brand purchases. A number of illustrations of laddering insights and their implications for the marketing mix are given to show how laddering can help marketers understand and revitalize brand equity."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.54367/jmb.v11i1.117","publication_year":2017,"title":"PENERAPAN MARKETING MIX TERHADAP BRAND EQUITY PERGURUAN TINGGI SEBAGAI SEBUAH TINJAUAN LITERATUR","cited_by_count":2,"authors":["Roslinda Sagala"],"abstract":"The process of marketing mix (marketing mix) are successful have a positive impact on brand equity (brand equity).

Academics have been researching brand equity, return on investment and effects of product differentiation for many years, but there has been little work that has taken a holistic view. Design/methodology/approach – The author studied an aggregate data set for 735 fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) brands, taken from Nielsen (10,282 households). Regression analysis was used in the first step, a cluster analysis in the second step of modeling procedure. Findings – The study suggests that brand equity, marketing investment and product differentiation are closely associated with price. Using a cluster analysis, the authors found that the premium price is significantly associated with product differentiation based on innovation and company type. Practical implications – The managerial implications of the models estimated by regression analysis are discussed as well as the results of the cluster analysis and possible research enhancements. Originality/value – The role of the value in brand performance output has not been investigated in the financial context, only in consumer or marketing mix context. Little is known about how price strategy depends on brand equity, product innovation activities or marketing investments intended to improve brand performance, neither how this strategy improves brand performance among different players in the market (retailers, SMEs and MNCs)."},{"doi":null,"publication_year":2008,"title":"The Affect of Selected Marketing Mix Elements on Brand Equity","cited_by_count":1,"authors":["K.

It identifies the relevant marketing activities and determines the extent to which these activities contribute to brand equity. Specifically, the proposed brand equity model relates marketing activities to brand equity. This indicates a practical way to assess the importance and adequacy of a company's daily operation in contributing to its brand equity. The importance-efficiency mix further provides management with feasible suggestions on adjusting their marketing activities. Then, based on an importance-efficiency matrix, company resources can be adjusted to enhance brand equity. An empirical study with an insurance company was conducted to illustrate the proposed approach. Using this approach, the insurance company has successfully enhanced their brand equity. This clearly attests to the managerial value of the proposed approach.

Through the application of the positivist research philosophy, the study employs regression analysis to ascertain the influence of the 7 Ps of the service marketing mix on brand equity. The results empirically demonstrate the important contribution of the three 3 Ps to brand equity. Place, Promotion and Physical evidence have been found to significantly impact the brand equity of OFD platforms. The influences of other predictors (product, price, people and process) are weak and are not making a significant contribution to the prediction of brand loyalty towards online food delivery service. By fully embracing the potential of the services marketing mix, managers and enterprises can maximize the advantages offered by this expanding industry, foster a competitive advantage, and contribute to the development of a sustainable OFD market, which in turn benefits the broader business, society, and economy. This study is one of the first studies measuring the impact of service marketing mixes on brand equity in the growing food delivery marketplace."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1536-7150.1998.tb03475.x","publication_year":1998,"title":"The Reality of Brands:","cited_by_count":66,"authors":["Wolfgang Grassi"],"abstract":"A bstract he ontology of marketing, particularly the question of what products and brands are, is still largely unexplored. The ontological status of brands hinges on their relationship with products. Idealists about brands see perceptual or cognitive acts of consumers grouped under the heading brand awarencess' or ‘brand image’ as constitutive for the existence of brands so that, in their view, tools of the marketing mix can influence relevant mental dispositions and attitudes. Brand realists, on the other hand reject the view of brands as mere marks or names and interpret them as emergent products with properties that afford branding in the sense of Gibson's ecological psychology. Brand strength is a function of the degree to which brands occupy defensible niches in product space. Branding as a process involves changing external or internal boundaries of products. Several arguments are proposed in favor of brand realism. The fragments of an ontology of marketing are developed in a broadly Aristotelian framework. Brand realism has significant implications for a new understanding of issues ranging from the effects of advertising to financial brand valuation, the nature of trademarks, and marketing strategy in general. It permits one to treat brand equity as a real phenomenon not dependent on associations, attitudinal states such as brand loyalty, or spurious constructs such as brand character or personality."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1108/jgr-09-2013-0012","publication_year":2014,"title":"Antecedents and consequences of strategic green marketing orientation","cited_by_count":44,"authors":["Hardeep Chahal","Ramesh Dangwal","Swati Raina"],"abstract":"Purpose – The study aims to propose four novel constructs of green satisfaction, green loyalty, green trust and green brand equity. It identifies the role of social marketing, relationship marketing, marketing orientation, general strategies, green marketing and marketing mix elements in enhancing financial and non-financial performance and ultimately the green brand equity. Green marketing strategies are gaining significant attention in the literature to support societal marketing concept vis-à-vis to enhance brand equity in the present competitive era. The present study conceptualizes a novel strategic green marketing orientation (SGMO) concept. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon the extant literature to present a series of research propositions relating to SGMO. Findings – The study provides new insight to marketing management by highlighting the factors such as social marketing, relationship marketing and marketing orientation as the constituent elements which facilitate the development of SGMO in an organization. Further, the study has put emphasis on SGMO- performance relationship which is mediated by green trust, green satisfaction and green loyalty. Finally, it advances an understanding in enhancing green brand equity of the organization. Research limitations – Being conceptual in nature, the paper needs to be empirically tested across manufacturing and service sectors. Further, lack of generalization of the scale items in various sectors needs to be researched in the future research.

The paper opens by identifying CBBE as a paradox for green marketing strategies and a short discussion on CBBE as a vital strategic bridge. The paper provides some accessible reflections on CBBE and GMM-S within the hotels in the Matale District, Sri Lanka. Three main dimensions that measure the CBBE are: brand loyalty, perceived brand quality and brand trust while green marketing strategies are; green product, green pricing, green place and green promotion. The survey approach has been used as the research strategy and this is a cross-sectional study. Both primary and secondary data were used for the study. The population of this study was green hotels located in the Matale District, Sri Lanka. A sample of 11 hotels was selected by administering the purposive sampling technique. A self-administrated questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale was utilised for collecting the primary data. The collected data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Cronbach’s alpha values confirmed the reliability of the data. Results of linear regression analysis indicated a significant, positive impact of GM strategies on CBBE in the hotel industry in Sri Lanka.

Despite the importance of these partnerships, conditions that may jeopardize what can be a long-term relationship for both sides are underresearched. Utilizing survival analysis modeling to examine a longitudinal dataset of 69 global sponsorships, the purpose of this research is to isolate factors that predict the dissolution of such partnerships and test a dynamic, integrated model of sponsorship decision-making. From the perspective of the sponsoring firm, congruence and high levels of brand equity were found to reduce the hazard of dissolution. Results indicate that economic conditions, such as an inflationary economy, are a statistically significant predictor of sponsorship dissolution. Increased clutter was also detrimental, with every one sponsor added increasing the hazard of dissolution, demonstrating the importance of exclusivity in global sponsorships."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1123/jsm.10.3.250","publication_year":1996,"title":"Strategic Implications of Attitude-Toward-the-Ad in Leveraging Event Sponsorships","cited_by_count":60,"authors":["Lance Kinney","Stephen R.

Ambush marketers are those companies that use advertising to make it appear as if they are associated with the Games without purchasing official sponsorship rights (Sandier &amp; Shani, 1989).

Virtually, enhancing equity and affecting customer behavior depends on the effective use of all the marketing-mix elements. While, brand awareness relates to whether a brand name comes to mind when consumers think about a particular product category, and the ease with which that name is evoked. Brand awareness is the basic dimension of brand equity. From an indivual consummer’s perspective a brand has no equity unless the consummer is at least aware of the brand. Achieving brand awareness is the initial challenge for new brands, while maintaining high levels of brand awareness is an ongoing task for all established brands.

Similar to findings in marketing, our results suggested that job seekers' intentions were directly affected by two dimensions of employment brand equity: brand associations (measured as attraction and perceived job attributes) and perceived quality. In addition, we found that a third dimension of employment brand equity, awareness with the company, was indirectly related to intentions through its effect on attraction, perceived job attributes, and perceived quality. Also similar to the findings in marketing, we found that a mix of recruitment practices (similar to a mix of marketing activities) were significantly related to the dimensions of brand equity. Although most of the recruitment practices have significant and positive effect on the dimensions of perceive employment brand equity, some appear to be more effective than others. In particular, participation in career fairs and building relationships with key university contacts had more consistently positive effects on the brand equity dimensions than did other early recruitment practices such as advertising and sponsorship.

In particular, firms are increasingly using cause-related marketing (CRM) to achieve business as well as social objectives, yet there has been limited research comparing the effectiveness of this strategy to other communication methods that may achieve similar brand-related outcomes. Using an experimental design, we examine consumer attitudes toward CRM and CRM's impact on brand attitude compared with two other communication options: sponsorship and sales promotion. Our results show that consumers respond more positively to CRM and that this strategy can be more effective in achieving brand-related objectives. However, consumers must perceive that the partnered cause fits with the brand. In fact, perception of fit plays a more critical role in determining the impact of CRM than in the impact of sponsorship or sales promotion. These findings suggest that when firms are considering their communication mix, CRM can be a more effective way of developing favorable brand associations, but managers must associate with causes that consumers will perceive to fit with the brand. Furthermore, this fit should be communicated."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.9790/5933-0801031218","publication_year":2017,"title":"Brand Equity on Purchase Intention Consumers’ Willingness to Pay Premium Price Juice","cited_by_count":28,"authors":["Ariesta Bougenvile","Endang Ruswanti"],"abstract":"Building the brand equity becomes an important source of differentiation.The company needed to improve competition, because the brand equity is very important to strengthen the company's reputation.However, there are only few studies on beverage value from the consumers' standpoint.And most of the researches had focused in the variables of marketing mix influencing consumers, such as price, communication, distribution or advertising.Congruence with this issue, the research have two objectives, the first objective is understanding consumer mind through brand equity in purchasing a product and willingness to pay premium price.The second is how the strategy should be done by a newcomer to the juice category.Based on sample of 330 consumers, Structural Equation Modeling is used to test hypotheses.The research shows that brand loyalty of juice is the most important dimension to build brand equity.In addition, a positive significant effect is found for brand awareness and association.Meanwhile, weak support is found for the perceived quality dimensions.Empirical support to the effect of juice's brand equity impacts on the consumers' purchase intention and willingness to pay premium price.This research brings relevant implication to the manager of juice production that should consider the relative importance of brand equity dimensions in their overall brand equity evaluationsin creating the consumers' purchase intention and willingness to pay premium price."},{"doi":null,"publication_year":2001,"title":"Sponsorship - a Confirmed Weapon in the Promotional Armoury. (Analysis)","cited_by_count":35,"authors":["John A.

This paper sets out to review the industry's current understanding of sponsorship as a promotional mechanism. As the medium's underlying principles are identified, marketing practitioners are provided with examples and strategic guidelines so that they are able to maximise their sponsorship investments. Keywords: Sponsorship, Communications Mix, Brand Equity and Ambush Marketing Executive Summary Sponsorship gained popularity amongst marketers as an effective brand equity-building strategy following the staging of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. Over the last two decades, sponsorship has clearly outperformed other promotional tools in terms of growth. Through technological developments, sponsorship is able to deliver brand messages to a diverse number of audiences on a global scale. Consequently, sponsorship has become a prime vehicle for marketers to achieve their marketing objectives. The importance of sponsorship marketing is typified by the medium's ever-increasing share of a company's marketing communications mix. From a marketing perspective, knowledge and expertise in sponsorship management is in demand as companies are increasingly being inundated with sponsorship proposals and the realisation of sponsorship as a potent brand-building tool. This paper reviews the extent to which the sponsorship industry has journeyed towards understanding its own mechanisms for success and sponsorship's role in the marketing mix. Marketing professionals who are contemplating the thought of associating with a sports property or those marketers who are looking to extract additional value out of their current sponsorship arrangements will derive utility from the sponsorship theories outlined in this review. Furthermore, sports property owners may find this paper of interest as insights can be gained into key sponsor considerations which will help them in their efforts to secure vital sponsorship funds. As sponsorship's underlying principles are identified throughout the paper, the implications for practitioners and standards of best practice are discussed. Sponsorship success is dependent upon whether sponsorship objectives were achieved. Thus, the formulation of objectives is very important as the post-sponsorship assessment is very difficult otherwise. To maximise sponsorship effectiveness, it is advised that sponsors leverage their investments with other elements of the communications mix such as advertising, public relations and sales promotion activities. By integrating sponsorship with other promotional tools, sponsors also minimise the threat of ambush marketing which aims to reduce the impact of sponsorship. Introduction Sponsorship has the potential to become the marketing communication tool of the 21st century. This conjecture is not so hard to believe for those who have witnessed the proliferation of the sponsorship medium over the last two decades. Marketers now recognise sponsorship as an effective promotional alternative vis-a-vis other marketing communication tools. The paper begins by articulating a working definition of sponsorship and outlining the medium's recent growth and future potential. The need to set sponsorship objectives and target specific audiences is detailed before explaining sponsorship's role in driving brand equity. Next, the distinction between sponsorship and advertising is made followed by the recommendation to leverage investments in order to achieve maximum effectiveness. This can be achieved by integrating sponsorship within both the communications and marketing mixes. By implementing an integrated approach to sponsorship investments, marketers also minimise the threat from competitors' ambush marketing tactics. Finally, two schools of thought of how sponsorship works are then presented before concluding with a brief summary of key concepts which have been outlined in this paper and future sponsorship developments. …"},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1108/gkmc-10-2018-0088","publication_year":2019,"title":"Web-based marketing communication to develop brand image and brand equity of higher educational institutions","cited_by_count":24,"authors":["Md.

Higher education is not an exception. However, configuring the right mix in the age of social networking sites and various online displays and constantly changing algorithm in search engine optimization have become major challenges today. Hence, the purpose of this study is to configure integrated online marketing communication for the development of brand image and brand equity for higher educational institutions. Design/methodology/approach The study is quantitative in nature. A responsive group of 370 students was chosen from different educational institutions in Malaysia via stratified random sampling techniques. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used for interpreting the data. To test the derived hypotheses, structural equation modelling was used. Findings In line with contemporary literature, the study revealed positive relationships between brand image and brand equity, between search engine and brand image and between social media and brand image. The relationship between online display and brand image was not found significant. Research limitations/implications Future research can be done considering both online and conventional marketing communications for the same purpose. This approach can also be used for private and public institutions separately, considering their differences in nature. Practical implications Because history and tradition are no more a single tool to attain and retain the positive image and customer-based brand equity, this study can help higher educational institutions to configure integrated online communication for their target groups, such as students and industry, in the age of the internet. Originality/value This study generates a comprehensive understanding of the impact of Web-based marketing communication to develop brand image and brand equity of higher educational institutions."},{"doi":null,"publication_year":2016,"title":"Services Marketing:People, Technology, Strategy","cited_by_count":79,"authors":["Jochen Wirtz","Christopher Lovelock"],"abstract":"I.

Faircloth","Louis M. Capella","Bruce L. Alford"],"abstract":"AbstractBrand equity has been criticized by some for an alleged lack of managerial relevance. This paper reports a study which operationalizes brand equity and empirically tests a conceptual model adapted from the work of Aaker (1991) and Keller (1993) considering the effect of brand attitude and brand image on brand equity. The results indicate that brand equity can be manipulated at the independent construct level by providing specific brand associations or signals to consumers and that these associations will result in images and attitudes that influence brand equity. The results suggest that focusing on the constructs that create brand equity is more relevant to managers than trying to measure it as an aggregated financial performance outcome.

The authors explore multiple times automobile buyers in India. Direct marketing mix variables like price, distribution intensity, store image, advertising frequency, price promotion were considered, while indirect marketing mix variables like country of origin, peer recommendation and celebrity endorsements have also been considered here. Brand equity has been defined as quality perceived by the consumers for a brand. The authors extended the model proposed by Yoo and Donthu (2000) to include indirect marketing mix variables also. It was found that there are primary and secondary cues affecting brand equity. While primary cues individually affect the brand equity, secondary cues do so in conjunction with primary cues. But alone, secondary cues have no impact on brand equity per se. Brand equity is impacted by both direct and indirect factors which are under the purview of marketing mix for multiple time buyers also, though intuitively such consumers are expected to be less affected by such variables. Our finding is important especially for manufacturers in the Indian context, as in India, consumers are increasingly having disposable income and hence are altering not only their automobiles, but also their household consumer durable goods. We believe that this research would help manufacturers optimally position their products to gain maximum mileage to their bottom line. Effect of interaction of different marketing and non marketing mix parameters that impacts brand equity has been studied. To the best of our knowledge, such a study has not been conducted before.

Functional integration involves coordinating supply- and demand-focused activities and is theorized to create two interrelated benefits for consumers: lower perceived purchase risk and, ultimately, higher consumer-based brand equity.

These decisions are important not only for the firm but also for various intermediaries in the distribution channel. While prices can be decided purely on cost or demand considerations, their effectiveness is vastly improved when they are set in consonance with various other aspects of the brand's marketing strategy (for example, such aspects as target market, firm's objectives, competitive positioning, functional versus emotional benefits offered by the product, and the like). Further, price decisions need to be made for transactions at different levels in the channel, because the definition of 'price' differs considerably from orte distribution level to another and even from one consumption situation to another. Even though decisions on price are offen difficult to make, firms should find them to be easier to implement. Further, competitors can react more quickly to appeals based on price as compared to those based on product benefits and imagery. As an example, one may think about the extensive price-promotion activity in various markets (e.g. coffee, automobiles) without any change in either the product quality or advertising appeals. Several pressures (both upward and downward) operate on the firm in the process of arriving at a thoughtful and deliberate pricing decision (or strategy). Upward pressures include unique product features, company reputation (or brand equity), product costs aiad supply of raw material, while factors such as availability of substitutes, price controls and competition operate as downward pressures. Over the last two decades, business firms have designed and implemented a wide fange of innovative pricing strategies (over and above the traditional cost-plus pricing and value pricing) in an effort to cope with various competitive and other externat forces (see Tellis [1986] for a taxonomy of these strategies)."},{"doi":null,"publication_year":2009,"title":"MARKETING MIX AND BRANDING: COMPETITIVE HYPERMARKET STRATEGIES","cited_by_count":15,"authors":["Hui-Chu Chen","Robert D.

Despite strong interest in the subject, however, there is little empirical evidence of how brand value is created and what its precise effects are. This study explores some of the consequences of brand equity. In particular, the authors examine the effect of brand equity on consumer preferences and purchase intentions. For comparative purposes, two sets of brands are tested, one from a service category characterized by fairly high financial and functional risk (hotels), and one from a generally lower risk product category (household cleansers). Each set includes two brands that are objectively similar (based on Consumer Reports ratings), but they have invested markedly different levels of advertising spending over the past decade. Across both categories, the brand with the higher advertising budget yielded substantially higher levels of brand equity.

However, such a reduction misses several important criteria that firms have to satisfy if they want to become truly sustainable. This article discusses how the concept of sustainable development has evolved over the past three decades and particularly how it can be applied to the business level. It then goes on to describe the three types of capital relevant within the concept of corporate sustainability: economic, natural and social capital. From this basis we shall then develop the six criteria managers aiming for corporate sustainability will have to satisfy: eco‐efficiency, socio‐efficiency, eco‐effectiveness, socio‐effectiveness, sufficiency and ecological equity.

To this aim, with creating and using the powerful brand equities,the firms have entered into different competitive fields. Also, in the marketing activities the relationship with customer is the main pivot and getting the customers' attraction is the priority of all the firms. On the other hand, with the advancement of the nutrition industry of the world, the relationship brand equity for the nutritional companies in order to attract more customers as well as seeking more income has been accentuated which is one of the main components of the firms' success. In this study, the marketing mix effect on the relationship brand equity and its effect on the customers' purchase intention of the two well-known brands of the dairy industry of Iran have been discussed. The sample of the study included 522 consumers in Iran. The data analysis has been done using LISREL 8.5 and SPSS 16.00 Software. The results indicate that two factors of advertisement and the target brands promotions of this industry have a significant effect on the perceived quality, while with increasing the price component of the perceived quality by customers have been decreased. On the other side, the perceived quality has also a significant effect on the brand equity. Finally, the results indicate that the relationship brand equity has a significant effect on the customers' purchase intention on these brands. At the end, some suggestions for improving the active companies' function in this industry as well as suggestions for the future studies have been provided."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.64.4.65.18071","publication_year":2000,"title":"A Benefit Congruency Framework of Sales Promotion Effectiveness","cited_by_count":1406,"authors":["Pierre Chandon","Brian Wansink","Gilles Laurent"],"abstract":"Are monetary savings the only explanation for consumer response to a sales promotion? If not, how do the different consumer benefits of a sales promotion influence its effectiveness? To address the first question, this research builds a framework of the multiple consumer benefits of a sales promotion. Through a series of measurement studies, the authors find that monetary and nonmonetary promotions provide consumers with different levels of three hedonic benefits (opportunities for value expression, entertainment, and exploration) and three utilitarian benefits (savings, higher product quality, and improved shopping convenience). To address the second question, the authors develop a benefit congruency framework, which argues that a sales promotion's effectiveness is determined by the utilitarian or hedonic nature of the benefits it delivers and the congruence these benefits have with the promoted product. Among other results, two choice experiments show that, as predicted for high-equity brands, monetary promotions are more effective for utilitarian products than for hedonic products. The authors then discuss the implications of the multibenefit and the benefit congruency frameworks for understanding consumer responses to sales promotions, reexamining the value of everyday-low-price policies, and designing more effective sales promotions."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1251817","publication_year":1990,"title":"Relationship Quality in Services Selling: An Interpersonal Influence Perspective","cited_by_count":3880,"authors":["Lawrence A.

Design/methodology/approach: It is postulated that marketing elements impact brand equity dimensions which in turn impact the brand equity construct. Five marketing mix elements were selected—price, distribution intensity, advertising, price promotions and non-price promotions, and four dimensions of brand awareness, brand loyalty, perceived quality and brand associations, finally to overall brand equity. Data were collected from a broad sample. Structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships among the 10 constructs. Findings: Brand loyalty and perceived quality have a significant impact on brand equity, whereas brand awareness and brand association were weak. Brand awareness has a significant influence on brand loyalty. Distribution intensity and non-price promotions have a positive relationship with all the brand equity dimensions, whereas weak support was determined for pricing and advertising. Conclusion: In the FMCG category building strong brand awareness combined with wide distribution and supported by non-price promotions are critical to building brand loyalty which in turn impacts brand equity.

Given this atmosphere in Korean fashion market, one of critical issues to survival for companies is a strong “brand power” with brand image (identity) and its strategic marketing Strong brands are viewed to differentiate themselves from unknown brands, resulting in favorable brand images that mirror the brand’s identity. As exploratory approach, this study identifies a strategic business focus on achieving brand power and provides an insight into developing effective brand positioning and fashion marketing strategy toward global markets. By focusing on a Korean fashion brand “Bean Pole”, objectives of this study are to profile the Cheil Industry in Samsung Group, define brand identity of the Bean Pole, and explore critical factors of strategic brand management. Korea’s economy ranks among the top 10 in the world, and its consumers have long been familiar with Western cultures through travel abroad and mass communications. Now, the Korean fashion marketplace is characterized by two market niches; (a) primarily domestically-produced, inexpensive apparel lines and (b) high-end collections dominated by designer brands imported mostly from the U.S. and Europe. More recently, apparel retail industry has shown strong rates of growth in South Korea, increasing its attractiveness to new entrants from foreign retailers. While some retailers selling apparel are highly diverse, many retailers still retain a strong emphasis on clothing, which intensifies rivalry. Cheil Industries is an affiliate of the Samsung Group, founded in 1954, as an initiative company with force in the development of textile industry, Korea. Today, the company has established a worldwide reputation for high quality and value in the three aspects: (a) leadership of electronic material in the IT area, (b) creating high profit by business structure of chemicals, and (c) gaining competitive fashion brand power. Currently, the Cheil Industry became a leading fashion firm with dominant brand power by launching various brands in domestic as well as foreign markets. As a traditional casual brand, “Bean Pole” launched in 1989 is currently expanding to family brands with different product lines. In 2005, the company had annual sales of $950million for fashion business. “Bean Pole” is the core fashion brand of the Cheil Industries, contributing 31% ($290million) of total sales in the fashion division in 2005. Now, the Bean Pole is number 1 brand in the retail venue of casual wear and children wear. Obviously, Bean Pole plays an important role as the best brand in achieving powerful brand asset of Cheil Industries’ fashion brands in Korea. This case study discusses Bean Pole from two aspects. The first thing is building brand salience. For fashion products, brand salience may be strongly related to brand image (or concept) including fashion image and style. The second thing is how to do strategic brand management. Strategic brand management involves the design and implementation of marketing programs and activities to build, measure, and manage brand equity. This study provides an insight into marketers and researchers to develop devise strategic brand management in the area of high-end fashion brand and underscore the inherent need for further, in-depth empirical research in the brand equity theory. A basic observation exemplify the brand identity of Bean Pole and its strategic brand management for sustaining strong brand equity in three aspects: brand extension, image positioning, and marketing mixes. In case of Bean Pole, success of marketing strategy for brand management heavily relies on its prestige image with high quality, establishing the brand equity. The brand equity can be leverage of brand extension entering into variety of new product categories within a same category of apparel. Especially, masstige brand positioning is critical to success of lifestyle brand extension for Bean Pole, which may have synergy effect on achieving strong brand value in both core brand and its extension. A strategic brand managing effort of Bean Pole can help companies establish brand equity. Fashion firms that are able to have a strong relationship with their customer should real a host of value, such as salient brand identity, premium brand price, and efficient marketing programs. Such understanding Bean Pole’s business focus allow marketers or retailers to entry into global brand extensions."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.15728/bbr.2016.13.1.4","publication_year":2016,"title":"Comparative Analysis of the Antecedents and Dimensions of Brand Equity Between Food Processors’ Brands and Supermarket’s Private Labels","cited_by_count":7,"authors":["José Castelo","José Cabral","Arnaldo Coelho"],"abstract":"This paper evaluates the relationship between the marketing mix elements and the creation of brand equity based on a conceptual framework defined from the state of the art marketing literature.

Where less significant development can be observed is in the area of sponsorship evaluation. This paper outlines a specific company case study focusing on a relatively new, but now well-established brand, which made a significant strategic choice in utilizing sponsorship for brand building, market penetration, and the acquisition and retention of consumers in an increasingly commodified service category in contrast to the strategic mix chosen by its main competitors. The paper provides a detailed focus on the management and evaluation of their sponsorship activity in one particular market. Following a brief introduction to the O2 brand and its international development, it will examine the brand's position in the Irish marketplace and the strategically chosen role for sponsorship in its armory of marketing options. It details the key strategic pillars, which underpin the approach to sponsorship as a set of beliefs that hold sponsorship policy and activation together. The challenge, in a mature market dominated by competition for market share, was to drive short-term sales while building long-term brand equity. The industry was experiencing a paradigm shift from “mobile operators” to “social networks” and the paper explains how the choice and activation of sponsorships sought to develop participative interaction with customers to promote emotionally driven loyalty. To make the brand the basis for differentiation the company chose a marketing mix weighted toward sponsorship and placed “participation” at the core of activation. The strategic choices involved regarding the balance of resources between paid-for media and sponsorship and in the latter case, between assets and activation, are explored. Two case studies relating to sport and entertainment sponsorship are detailed with particular reference to innovative and creative activation through social networks. The paper will outline the use of quantitative tracking measures as well as more involved measures in evaluating sponsorship performance. More specifically it will focus on the measurement of sponsorship performance and in particular on the various points at which measurement is brought to bear and the range of metrics—including softer measures such as sentiment analysis and social media conversations—utilized in this evaluation process. It will thus arrive at a comprehensive approach to measuring sponsorship effectiveness and demonstrate how results are translatable to monetary values."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.5539/ijms.v9n1p91","publication_year":2017,"title":"Investigating the Effect of Selected Marketing Efforts in Brand Equity Creation and Its Cross-Cultural Invariance in Emerging Markets","cited_by_count":8,"authors":["Isaac Twum Asare","Shen Lei"],"abstract":"In the field of brand management, numerous studies have been conducted on brand equity conceptualization, measurement and validation. Also, previous researchers have shown that consumer-based brand equity via its dimensions can be created and maintained through a company’s marketing mix activities. Brand equity according to Keller, is the differential effect of brand knowledge on consumer response to the marketing activities performed on the brand. Due to cultural differences, consumers’ reaction will differ and thus these marketing efforts will have varying results in different markets.Drawn from both Aaker’s &amp; Keller’s conceptualizations of brand equity, the current study develops a brand equity creation process model similar to Yoo et al.’s and examines its cross-cultural invariance through a structural invariance test using data from two important growing markets—Ghana and China. Results prove that some marketing efforts and dimensions of brand equity have invariant effects on brand equity across the Ghana and Chinese samples. Specifically, the effect of price on perceived quality was not equivalent in both markets. Relationship among brand equity dimensions were also not equivalent, however these dimensions all show an equivalent, positive effect on brand equity.

Neslin"],"abstract":"Conceptually, brand equity can be thought of as the incremental revenue that a product earns as a brand over the revenue it would earn if it were sold without the brand name. However, the brand can have an impact on revenue through a variety of mechanisms, e.g., reduced price sensitivity, higher advertising effectiveness, greater distribution etc. Developing a structural model of all these relationships is difficult, likely to contain specification error, and not very practical for managers. Instead, we propose a simple and easily quantifiable measure of brand equity. We base our measure on the implicit assumption that outcomes in the market involve optimal decisions by firms who select a price for their brands in order to maximize net revenue. Their decisions depend on the demand curves and costs faced by branded and unbranded goods. In essence, these revenues result from a reduced form of the complex relations among brand, marketing mix elements, and customers. Instead of trying to estimate the hypothetical revenue that a branded product would earn if it did not have the brand name, we use the revenue of the private label product as a reasonable benchmark. Hence, the difference in revenue between a branded good and the corresponding private label represents the equity of the particular brand. We calculate this measure for brands in twenty-three different packaged goods categories and validate it by examining its behavior over time and its association with other variables with which brand equity should be related in specific ways. The measure is reliable in that it correlates strongly with its lagged value. It exhibits a trend over time that is consistent with conventional wisdom on the erosion of brand equity during the past decade. As expected, it is positively associated with advertising but not with promotion. Further, it is positively associated with stockpileability and hedonic categories and negatively associated with private label quality. Finally, the up price elasticity, i.e., the effect on sales when price is increased, is significantly lower than the down price elasticity for high equity brands. Overall, the measure is simple, intuitive, and easy to calculate from public sources, and has fairly strong face and construct validity."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1177/002224298805200306","publication_year":1988,"title":"Cause-Related Marketing: A Coalignment of Marketing Strategy and Corporate Philanthropy","cited_by_count":1653,"authors":["P.

This is in addition, on the other, to a stakeholder segmentation that categorizes fans according to their connection with sport in a society of the spectacle. The proposed sportainment mix could boost the fan lifetime value, together with both the customer and financial-based brand equity."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-7998-4420-4.ch007","publication_year":2020,"title":"Banking Innovative Service With Digital Brand Equity for New Age Consumers","cited_by_count":13,"authors":["Sonu Dua","Inderpal Singh","Subhankar Das"],"abstract":"Digital banking is at the helm of all intangible transactions for the new age consumers in this world of touchless banking. So here in this chapter the authors tried to reconcile the new innovative content that will make this service to a notch higher. In goods industry, the product is considered as primary brand with various attributes. However, in case of services industry, the company itself is a primary brand. This research article is based upon primary research of services (banking) sector as a case of service branding with services extended marketing mix variables. A model has been developed to identify the impact of services extended marketing variables on customer-based brand equity. Two components of customer-based brand have been taken into consideration: brand awareness and brand association. For this purpose, structured questionnaire was prepared, and survey was conducted on 400 respondents and structural equation model has been applied."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.73.3.052","publication_year":2009,"title":"Brand Experience: What is It?

This platform indeed gives an opportunity to young artists to display their talents. However, Coke-studio platform differs in the musical journey and creates a little difference among India and Pakistan; both the countries are unique in its own way. This article is just to understand the components, which can contribute to the success of Coke-studio by developing a digital IMC model considering three major variables known as: brand values, brand equity and co-branding efforts. Digital IMC and its impact on brand equity, brand values through co-branding efforts have been explained with a help of a diagrammatic work, which can be a success ingredient for Coke-studio. Through a careful content analysis the issues in traditional IMC has been analysed and a new model has been framed. This model has been suggested to Coke-studio to manage better customer experience, satisfaction and loyalty which will help to build good relationship with the end users in the digital arena. In this competitive era, making the competitors best-friends and working on “Mutual Benefits” is the success mantra. This is explained with an illustration explaining the benefits enjoyed by YouTube and Coke-studio in the light of Co-branding efforts. Online Social Media (OSM) enhances the e-brand equity because the digital consumer spends a minimum of 2 hours online increasing the brand presence for the marketer. Brand reputation builds brand equity for which new digital tools and technological platforms are needed. Thus one of the focus in this article is to build a framework to show how brand equity, brand image and brand values are enhanced through a Digital IMC. The success of communication reach is embedded through a motivational touch, which is given to the final consumers creating a sense of integrity. In the domain of Human Resource Management many theories on motivation is available. This article makes use of Vroom’s Motivational theory and model in the IMC model to show the importance of motivation to enhance customer’s loyalty and trust. This research article is a complete new package for the current Digi-economy for all the stakeholders. From the Digital-IMC model, it is understood that, variables such as memorable, likable, transferable, adaptable and protectable are very important for any entertainment service provides which can enhance the brand to a superior level. It is also mentioned that brands can join hands together which benefits both the businesses, and at the same time better brand vales can be created through unique episodes. From the article it is understood that Integrated Brand Communication model is needed rather than using just an IMC model in a traditional way. This idea has been placed in scope for future research which can be explored in a better way in the golden tomorrow. Thus, never stop with IMC but travel beyond to reach out to the customers through digital integration, which is the simple philosophy to be understood from this article. Marketing and branding are never constant, it keeps changing day to day based on the latest technology and usage of digital tools. Long gone are days where marking was only place, price and product utility but now it is much more that dealing with Digital tools and applications. The IMC loop has to have important variables such as business objectives, strategic communication plans, marketing mix, brand mix bounded with digital tools and application to create e-experience. This model is open to the universe for feedback and usage."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1080.0406","publication_year":2008,"title":"Exploitation-Exploration Tensions and Organizational Ambidexterity: Managing Paradoxes of Innovation","cited_by_count":1914,"authors":["Constantine Andriopoulos","Marianne W.

Ambidextrous organizations excel at exploiting existing products to enable incremental innovation and at exploring new opportunities to foster more radical innovation, yet related research is limited. Largely conceptual, anecdotal, or single case studies offer architectural or contextual approaches. Architectural ambidexterity proposes dual structures and strategies to differentiate efforts, focusing actors on one or the other form of innovation. In contrast, contextual approaches use behavioral and social means to integrate exploitation and exploration. To develop a more comprehensive model, we sought to learn from five, ambidextrous firms that lead the product design industry. Results offer an alternative framework for examining exploitation-exploration tensions and their management. More specifically, we present nested paradoxes of innovation: strategic intent (profit-breakthroughs), customer orientation (tight-loose coupling), and personal drivers (discipline-passion). Building from innovation and paradox literature, we theorize how integration and differentiation tactics help manage these interwoven paradoxes and fuel virtuous cycles of ambidexterity. Further, managing paradoxes becomes a shared responsibility, not only of top management, but across organizational levels."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1108/00251740010379100","publication_year":2000,"title":"Brands and brand equity: definition and management","cited_by_count":707,"authors":["Lisa Wood"],"abstract":"This article assumes that brands should be managed as valuable, long‐term corporate assets.

In a juxtaposition of different industries it aims at: investigating whether both communication instruments have an impact on consumer‐based brand equity; comparing the effect sizes of these two communication instruments; and separating the effects of firm‐created and user‐generated social media communication. Design/methodology/approach A total of 393 data sets from three different industries, namely tourism, telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals, were generated using a standardized online‐survey. Structural equation modeling was used in the analysis of the data obtained to investigate the interplay of social media and traditional media in general, as well as in an examination of industry‐specific differences. Findings The results of the empirical study show that both traditional communications and social media communications have a significant impact on brand equity. While traditional media has a stronger impact on brand awareness, social media communications strongly influence brand image. Firm‐created social media communication is shown to have an important impact on functional brand image, while user‐generated social media communication exerts a major influence on hedonic brand image. Furthermore, the present study highlights significant differences between the industries under investigation. Originality/value The research described in this paper is pioneering in that it juxtaposes the impacts of social media and traditional media on brand equity – a topic of increasing interest to firms in the era of Facebook and Twitter but so far largely uninvestigated.

The ontological status of brands hinges on their relationship with products. Idealists about brands see perceptual or cognitive acts of consumers grouped under the heading ‘brand awareness’ or ‘brand image’ as constitutive for the existence of brands so that, in their view, tools of the marketing mix can influence relevant mental dispositions and attitudes. Brand realists, on the other hand, reject the view of brands as mere marks or names and interpret them as emergent products with properties that afford branding in the sense of Gibson’s ecological psychology. Brand strength is a function of the degree to which brands occupy defensible niches in product space. Branding as a process involves changing external or internal boundaries of products. Several arguments are proposed in favor of brand realism. The fragments of an ontology of marketing are developed in a broadly Aristotelian framework. Brand realism has significant implications for a new understanding of issues ranging from the effects of advertising to financial brand valuation, the nature of trademarks, and marketing strategy in general. It permits one to treat brand equity as a real phenomenon not dependent on associations, attitudinal states such as brand loyalty, or spurious constructs such as brand character or personality."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkg.69.2.42.60756","publication_year":2005,"title":"The Effects of Strategic Orientations on Technology- and Market-Based Breakthrough Innovations","cited_by_count":1680,"authors":["Kevin Zheng Zhou","Chi Kin (Bennett) Yim","David K.

A technology orientation is beneficial to technology-based innovations but has no impact on market-based innovations, and an entrepreneurial orientation facilitates both types of breakthroughs.

Separating the hype and \"meta…\" rebranding from current reality is difficult, as \"big tech\" paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale - one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people.

The authors maintain that the price fluctuations common to the many service industries that implement demand-oriented pricing, combined with the inherent heterogeneity of service performance, likely result in price–performance combinations that vary widely. Furthermore, the authors propose that the level of price–performance consistency in a service exchange moderates the relationship between performance expectations and subsequent performance and satisfaction judgments. When price and performance are consistent, expectations have an assimilation effect on performance and satisfaction judgments; when price and performance are inconsistent, expectations have no effect on performance and satisfaction judgments. To examine these issues, the authors develop a contingency model that they estimate using data from a multimedia experimental design. The results generally support the contingency framework and provide empirical support for normative guidelines that call for creating realistic performance expectations and offering money-back service guarantees."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.5958/2321-5763.2017.00211.6","publication_year":2017,"title":"Does Promotion Mix Really Help To Enhance Brand Equity: A Literature Review","cited_by_count":5,"authors":["Sandeep Kumar","Sidheswar Patra"],"abstract":"In the modern marketing, promotion is the most familiar strategy used by the various business organizations to fascinate the customer.

When analyzing the data, we applied the structural equation modeling technique to both investigate the interplay of firm-created and user-generated social media communication and examine industry-specific differences. The results of the empirical studies showed that user-generated social media communication had a positive influence on both brand equity and brand attitude, whereas firm-created social media communication affected only brand attitude.

The endorser credibility‐brand equity relationship was developed using associative learning principles whereas the brand signalling theory is applied to examine the mediating role of brand credibility. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual framework was tested using a field experiment. Data were collected using a mall‐intercept approach at a shopping centre from a sample of consumers in a metropolitan Australian city. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling.

Williams","DaeYeon Kim","Kwame Agyemang","Tywan G. Martin"],"abstract":"IntroductionIn today's highly competitive market, branding has become an integral part of marketing and management, as a traditional marketing mix approach alone is no longer sufficient to differentiate the product or service from that of competitors (Kapferer, 2012). As Keller (1998) quoted the famous words of Levitt (I960), New competition is not between what companies produce, but what they add in the form of things that people (p. 4). Managers now strive to understand consumer value to build strong brand equity. This includes sustainable growth drivers, such as brand loyalty, extension opportunity, as well as increasing sales and image enhancement (Aaker, 1996a, 1996b; Berry, 2000; Keller, 1998). This paradigm shift from product marketing to branding has changed our perspective from product-oriented management to customer-oriented (e.g., Aaker, 1991; Keller, 1993), and the sport industry is no exception.Sport managers and scholars realize that winning alone does not equal success for sport organizations (Gladden & Funk, 2001, 2002; Kaynak, Salman, & Tatoglu, 2007). As a result, sport managers and scholars now view and manage teams and organizations as brands and focus on the value consumers for the products and services they provide (e.g., Bauer, Sauer, & Schmitt, 2005; Gladden & Funk, 2002; Gladden, Milne, & Sutton, 1998; Ross, 2006; Ross, James, & Vargas, 2006). Prior studies have advanced our understanding of branding; however, with regard to sport, team sport brands have garnered most of the attention. Keller (2002) argued that branding research has focused exclusively on what he defined as the small b, whereas the industry has been applying large B concepts in various areas. For example, while practitioners across various areas (e.g., religion, politics, education, entertainment, sport) have advanced their application of branding to human beings (Rein, Kotier, & Shields, 2006), scholars have restricted the scope of inquiry to the inanimate targets such as corporations, products, and services (Hughes, 2007). Williams, Kim, Walsh, and Choi (2015) acknowledged this limitation and argued that future branding research should examine the role of the athlete in brand management research.Although referring to humans as brands is relatively new, in sport there are many examples of successful athletes who have enjoyed benefits from applying branding concepts to their careers (Arai, Ko, & Ross, 2013; Parmentier & Fischer, 2012). Furthermore, leagues, teams, and tournaments also benefit from athletes' high visibility as human brands. Examples include Tiger Woods, David Beckham, and Derek Jeter. Despite the prevalence of athletes using their celebrity status in the greater marketplace, researchers have not investigated this phenomenon (e.g., Arai, Ko, & Kaplanidou, 2013; Arai et ah, 2013; Hughes, 2007; Parmentier & Fischer, 2012; Thomson, 2006). Therefore, we reason that given the scope and utilization of athlete brands in the marketplace, a conceptualization of the various role athletes have in the brand architecture is warranted.The purpose of this article is to build and provide a foothold for further development of athlete-branding research. Therefore, in the ensuing sections of this article, we evaluate prior literature in order to define appropriately athletes as brands and subsequently present the Athlete Brand Relationship Spectrum (ABRS). The ABRS illustrates the various relationships that athlete brands have within sport-brand architecture.What Is an Athlete Brand?Research has suggested that, due to their celebrity status, athletes have the ability to influence consumers' perceptions towards a product, service, or organization (e.g., Boyd & Shank, 2004; Jowdy & McDonald, 2002; Ohanian, 1991; Till, 2001). Athletes have an integral role in helping organizations increase awareness and create positive associations for their products and services, all the while building their own personal brand (Erdogan, 1999). …"},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2370.2005.00109.x","publication_year":2005,"title":"Corporate reputation: Meaning and measurement","cited_by_count":769,"authors":["Rosa Chun"],"abstract":"Corporate reputation has attracted interest from a wide range of academic disciplines.

The construct of reputation and the allied constructs of image and identity are each reviewed. A structure is proposed in which the three constructs can be seen as labelling different but allied concepts. I then move on to consider how reputation has been measured. The paper uncovers considerable confusion in the use of what might appear to be basic terms and links this to a subsequent lack of grounded measurement tools in the sector, until relatively recently. With a clearer understanding of the construct of corporate reputation and the allied constructs of image and identity, researchers are now well placed to test the relationships widely claimed by practitioners between corporate reputation and other variables such as commercial performance and employee and customer satisfaction. The review ends by illustrating some of the issues that can be assessed from the basis of a clearer conceptualization of reputation and its measurement."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.87.6.1121","publication_year":2002,"title":"The relationship between early recruitment-related activities and the application decisions of new labor-market entrants: A brand equity approach to recruitment.","cited_by_count":529,"authors":["Christopher J.

Study 3 extends the model with a more naturalistic sample and tests several alternative hypotheses using hierarchical regression. The results suggest that when a human brand enhances a person's feelings of autonomy and relatedness and does not suppress feelings of competence, the person is likely to become more strongly attached to it. This article documents that strong attachments are predictive of satisfied, trusting, and committed relationships and proposes that attachment strength may be a parsimonious proxy for consumer–brand relationship strength.

Introduction The beverage industry and specifically the brewery sector is a key economic industry within the European agribusiness scenario. However, there are only few studies on beer brand value from the consumers' standpoint (Atilgan et al., 2005); and most of the researches had focused in the variables of marketing mix influencing consumers, such as price, communication, distribution or advertising (Yoo et al., 2000). Nevertheless, in the purchasing process, consumers are not only concerned about the price or quality of a product or brand, but also other variables such as the Brand Equity or value. Brand equity is an intangible asset, being a source of long-term competitive advantage in the marketplace, which cannot be completely understood without carefully analyzing its sources, or the variables related to its formation in consumers' mind. This research develops and empirical study applying the Aaker's Brand Equity model, in order to analyze the sources Brand Equity for a product with a great popularity and strong demand--that is, beer--, in specific European mature market--the Spanish marketplace--. This research is organized as follows. It begins with the theoretical foundations; then the objectives are set out; in the fourth section the methodology is explained, as well as the simple, the selected variables and the measurement scales used; next, the results are discussed, to end with some conclusions, implications and the research limitations. 2. Theorical Framework 2.1 Brand Equity conceptualization Building strong brands has become a marketing priority for many companies nowadays because it provides multiple advantages to establish and create an identity in the market place for a company, while being a key source of competitive advantage (Aaker, 1996). In order to measure the overall value of a determinate brand or product, marketing researchers and managers have begun to examine the concept of Brand Equity (Aaker, 1991; Keller, 1993), which refers to the tremendous value a brand brings to consumers and manufacturers. Following Aaker (1991, 1996), Brand Equity could be conceptualized as all of those tangible assets of a brand, held in the mind of the consumers. More precisely, Farquhar (1989) defines Brand Equity as the added value that a brand brings to a particular product or service, and points out that Brand Equity is that set of assets and liabilities linked to a brand, its name or symbol, that incorporate or decrease the value provided by a product or service to the company or its customers. Keller (1993) defines Brand Equity as the differential effect of brand knowledge on the response given by consumers to the brand marketing. The present research follows the theoretical model proposed by Aaker (1991), given that it represents an important reference for marketing scholars, through an integrative conceptualization of Brand Equity and because it has been empirically demonstrated by previous researches focused on manufacture brands (Yoo et al., 2000; Atilgan et al., 2005). Hence, we will define Brand Equity as the set of assets and liabilities linked to the brand, which either increase or decrease the value provided by a product or service to the consumer. 2.2. The dimensions of beer Brand Equity Nevertheless, Brand Equity cannot be completely understood without carefully analyzing its determinants and sources, or the contributing variables to the formation of Brand Equity in the consumers' mind. In the purchasing process, consumers are not only concerned about the price or quality of a product or brand, but also other variables such as the brand awareness or brand image (Aaker, 1991, 1996). Additionally, this study aims to analyze two consequences of Brand Equity on consumer behavior. For that purpose, we have proposed the analysis of two other dimensions, such as the consumers' purchase intention and their willingness to pay a premium price for the one specific beer brand. …"},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1108/10610420710731142","publication_year":2007,"title":"Does image of country‐of‐origin matter to brand equity?","cited_by_count":542,"authors":["Norjaya Mohd Yasin","Mohd Nasser Noor","Osman Mohamad"],"abstract":"Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of brand's country‐of‐origin image on the formation of brand equity. Design/methodology/approach To accomplish this, the brand equity of household electrical appliances, particularly televisions, refrigerators and air‐conditioners, in the Malaysian market is examined. A conceptual framework in which brand's country‐of‐origin image is postulated to influence the dimensions of brand equity, which is made up of brand loyalty, brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand associations. These dimensions, in turn, influence brand equity. Data were collected from consumers of household electrical appliances using probability sampling. Findings Factor analysis conducted on brand equity dimensions, produced three factors namely, brand distinctiveness, brand loyalty, and brand awareness/associations. The regression analysis results show that brand's country‐of‐origin image positively and significantly influences dimensions of brand equity. The results also show that brand's country‐of‐origin image influences brand equity, either directly or indirectly, through the mediating effects of brand distinctiveness, brand loyalty and brand awareness/associations.

It only considers brand's country‐of‐origin image as one of the sources of brand equity. The conceptual framework does not take into consideration factors that moderate the influence of antecedent of brand equity on brand equity. Practical implications Producers of household electrical appliances should put greater emphasis in creating brand loyalty for their products.

Advances in information technology and the emergence of online social network sites have changed the way information is transmitted. This phenomenon impacts consumers as this easily accessible information could greatly affect the consumption decision. The purpose of this paper is to examine the extent to which e‐WOM among consumers can influence brand image and purchase intention in the automobile industry. Design/methodology/approach Measurement items are adapted from existing scales found in the marketing literature. Academic colleagues reviewed the items for face validity and readability. The scales are evaluated for reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity using data collected in a survey of Iran Khodro's prospective customers in Iran. A structural equation modeling procedure is applied to the examination of the influences of e‐WOM on brand image and purchase intention. The research model was tested empirically using a sample of 341 respondents who had experience within online communities of customers and referred to Iran Khodro's agencies during the period of research. Findings The paper found that e‐WOM is one of the most effective factors influencing brand image and purchase intention of brands in consumer markets. Research limitations/implications The paper outlines ways to promote a brand effectively through online customer communities, as well as general tips for website and forum moderators for facilitating such presentation in a manner useful to the members of their online communities. While there is a substantial research stream that examines the branding of consumers goods and an increasing literature on product brands, little is known about brand image in the context of online communications. This paper extends existing measurement of brand image to a new setting, namely e‐WOM. Originality/value This paper provides valuable insight into the measurement of e‐WOM, brand image, and purchase intention in the automobile industry and offers a foundation for future product branding research."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1177/109467050032001","publication_year":2000,"title":"Strengthening the Satisfaction-Profit Chain","cited_by_count":1522,"authors":["Eugene W.

Disenchanted, some have labeled satisfaction measurement a “trap” and argued for abandoning customer satisfaction as a means for optimizing customer retention and profitability. The authors argue that doing so may be a mistake because the satisfaction-profit chain is conceptually solid. However, to achieve results, an important step is to recognize that the links in the satisfaction-profit chain are asymmetric and nonlinear. In this article, the authors review recent developments pertaining to the asymmetric and nonlinear nature of the links involved. They also discuss several examples based on commercial satisfaction studies where incorporating the asymmetry and nonlinearity added significant value to the firm’s understanding of the satisfaction-profit chain."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.1257/0895330053147958","publication_year":2005,"title":"The Impact of Social Structure on Economic Outcomes","cited_by_count":2669,"authors":["Mark Granovetter"],"abstract":"The author focus here on sociologists' contributions to the impact of social structure and networks on the economy.

In this empirical analysis, the authors use survey and experimental data on orange juice and personal computers collected from respondents in Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Spain, Turkey, and the United States. The results provide strong empirical evidence across countries for the role of brands as signals of product positions. In addition, the positive effect of brand credibility on choice is greater for consumers who rate high on either collectivism or uncertainty avoidance. Credible brands provide more value to collectivist consumers because such consumers perceive these brands as being of higher quality (i.e., reinforcing group identity). Credible brands provide more value to high-uncertainty-avoidance consumers because such brands have lower perceived risk and information costs."},{"doi":null,"publication_year":2013,"title":"The Impact of Advertising on Building Brand Equity: A Case of Zimbabwean Universities","cited_by_count":7,"authors":["Munyaradzi Mutsikiwa","Kossam Dhliwayo","Clay Hutama Basera"],"abstract":"Over the years studies have been done that sought to establish the effect of advertising on building brand equity for producers of physical products. This study in particular focuses on the impact of advertising (print, outdoor and broadcast) on building brand equity for universities in Zimbabwe. The research was based on the premise that little research has been done on establishing advertising’s role in building brand equity for non–profit making organisations in a highly competitive marketing environment. A quantitative survey research was employed which adopted a descriptive survey design to explore the relationship between selected advertising variables and brand equity. A sample size of 150 (90 males and 60 females) was used to gather data using a structured questionnaire. A quota sampling technique was adopted proportionately (11 males and 4 females) from the selected institutions. A multiple regression model was used to establish the correlation between the two variables. Data analysis was executed using SPSS version 14.0. The overall findings of the research were reflective of the fact that Zimbabwean universities have not been proactively employing advertising in order to build brand equity and the implications are that there is need for those running these institutions to take a more positive and proactive stance to effectively blend advertising variables in order to develop hybrid advertising mix strategies which can help their not-for-profit making organizations to develop reputable brands capable of attracting a potential large market.

Strategic alliances, in this view, are embedded in a firm's strategic portfolio, and co-evolve with the firm's strategy, the institutional, organizational and competitive environment, and with management intent for the alliance. Specifically, we argue that alliance intent may be described, at any time, as having either exploitation or exploration objectives.

The results of this empirical study, using data collected from 12 luxury hotels, indicate that brand loyalty, perceived quality, and brand image are important components of consumer‐based brand equity.

A review of detailed measures constituting these three variables, brand loyalty, brand awareness, and brand image, shows that most measures affect financial performances of hotels.

Corporate social responsibility requires investment and it yields measurable outcomes.It is commonly accepted that cause-related marketing is a communications tool for increasing customer loyalty and building reputation. The expected change in a company's image because of CRM campaigns appears to depend a great deal upon how customers perceive the reasons for a company's involvement in cause-related programmes and the amount of help given to the cause through a company's involvement (Webb and Mohr, 1998).

Open international trade has encouraged nations to specialize in different branches of manufacturing and even in different stages of production within a specific industry. This process, fueled by the explosion of new products and new technologies since World War II, has led to the emergence of a global manufacturing system in which production capacity is dispersed to an unprecedented number of developing as well as industrialized countries (Harris, 1987; Gereffi, 1989b). The revolution in transportation and communications technology has permitted manufacturers and retailers alike to establish international production and trade networks that cover vast geographical distances. While considerable attention has been given to the involvement of industrial capital in international contracting, the key role played by commercial capital (i.e., large retailers and brand-named companies that buy but don't make the goods they sell) in the expansion of manufactured exports from developing countries has been relatively ignored. This chapter will show how these 'big buyers' have shaped the production networks established in the world's most dynamic exporting countries, especially the newly industrialized countries (NICs) of East Asia. The argument proceeds in several stages. First, a distinction is made between producer-driven and buyer-driven commodity chains, which represent alternative modes of organizing international industries. These commodity chains, though primarily controlled by private economic agents, are also influenced by state policies in both the producing (exporting) and consuming (importing) countries. Second, the main organizational features of buyer-driven commodity chains are identified, using the apparel industry as a case study. The apparel commodity chain contains two very different segments. The companies that make and sell standardized clothing have production patterns and sourcing strategies that contrast with firms in the fashion segment of the industry, which has been the most actively committed to global sourcing. Recent changes within the retail sector of the United States are analyzed in this chapter to identify the emergence of new types of big buyers and to show why they have distinct strategies of global sourcing. Third, the locational patterns of global sourcing in apparel are charted, with an emphasis on the production frontiers favored by different kinds of US buyers. Several of the primary mechanisms used by big buyers to source products from overseas are outlined in order to demonstrate how transnational production systems are sustained and altered by American retailers and branded apparel companies. </div>"},{"doi":null,"publication_year":2009,"title":"A Conjoint Approach for Consumer - and Firm-Level Brand Valuation","cited_by_count":6,"authors":["Kamel Jedidi","Harsharanj S. Jagpal","Madiha Ferjani"],"abstract":"Previous research has identified four sources of brand equity: biased perceptions; image associations; incremental value, a component that that is not related to product attributes or benefits; and inertia value. This article develops a utility model that captures all these sources of brand equity; in particular, the model provides estimates of consumer-level brand equity at different levels of aggregation and also estimates firm-level brand equity.The proposed reduced-form conjoint methodology approach allows for different information-processing strategies by consumers, provides objective dollar-metric values for brand equity without the need to collect perceptual or brand association data, captures the nonrecursive effects of awareness and availability in the marketplace as sources of brand equity, accounts for competitive reaction, allows the mix of branded and unbranded firms to affect industry size, and uses consideration set theory to project market share estimates from the conjoint experiment to the marketplace.There are two critical design features of the methodology: The experiment must include unbranded products for determining the values for products with no brand equity, and to obtain unambiguous dollar-metric estimates of brand equity, all choice sets in the conjoint experiment must include the no-purchase option. At the firm level, the two key features of the model are that it must explicitly allow brand equity to depend on objective measures of awareness and availability and the marketing policies (e.g., market prices and advertising levels) of all products in the industry are endogenously determined. Thus, the model provides objective estimates for brand equity after simultaneously allowing for competitive reaction, demand and supply adjustments, and consumer heterogeneity.Consumer-level brand equity is defined as the difference in the consumer's willingness to pay for a branded product with a given set of features and an identical unbranded product. Firm-level brand equity is defined as the incremental profitability that the firm would earn operating with the brand name compared with operating without it. Because the proposed method provides dollar-metric values for firm-level brand equity and for consumer-level brand equity at different levels of aggregation, managers can use this approach to develop customized strategies for targeting customers, monitoring brand 'health,' allocating resources, revising a brand's marketing policies over time, and determining the values of brands that they seek to buy or sell in a merger or acquisition.The authors test the proposed methodology, and the results compare with those from extant methods. At the consumer level, the empirical results suggest that the proposed metric for measuring brand equity has convergent validity; in addition, the magnitudes and strengths of brand equity vary considerably across consumers and brands. At the firm level, the results show that previous methods (e.g., those based on revenue premiums, information from industry experts, or Dubin's methodology) are likely to overstate brand equity, especially for products with low market shares. Finally, external validation tests show that the proposed reduced-form conjoint methodology for measuring brand equity is robust."},{"doi":"https://doi.org/10.22495/cbsrv4i2siart16","publication_year":2023,"title":"Effects of corporate marketing strategy, brand awareness, and perceived quality on brand equity for accounting service","cited_by_count":3,"authors":["Pham Thi Bich Thu","Le Thi Binh"],"abstract":"Brand equity and trust are consistently the most important antecedents to both behavioral and attitudinal forms of customer loyalty (Taylor et al., 2004). Accounting service refers to a service that offers bookkeeping, accounting, and reporting in alignment with both local and international accounting regulations. These services possess unique qualities, necessitating the service providers to establish themselves as reputable entities. It is crucial for them to maintain their brand equity to attract and retain customers. Thus, the study aims to identify and measure the influence of marketing mix, brand awareness, and perceived quality on brand equity for accounting services in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam. Quantitative data were collected, including 385 businesses using accounting services at all levels across the country. The research results show that all elements of the marketing mix (product quality, price, distribution, and advertising), brand awareness, and perceived quality have a positive impact on brand equity for accounting services in Thanh Hoa province.

What of them?","cited_by_count":832,"authors":["John M.T. Balmer","Edmund R. Gray"],"abstract":"Abstract This article examines the nature, importance, typology, and management of corporate brands. Argues that in making a distinction between corporate brands, corporate identities, and product brands, the underlying characteristics of corporate brands can be uncovered. A key thesis of the article is that a corporate brand is a valuable resource: one that provides an entity with a sustainable, competitive advantage if specific criteria are met. These criteria are defined in terms of an economic theory known as \"the resource‐based view of the firm\". An affirmation of this economic doctrine requires corporate brands to be rare, durable, inappropriable, imperfectly imitable, and imperfectly substitutable. Also contends that the traditional tripartite, branding typology be expanded to reflect the new modes in which corporate brands are being utilised. These new corporate branding categories are: familial, shared, surrogate, supra, multiplex, and federal. Finally, reasons that the management of a corporate brand requires the orchestration of six \"identity types\". The critical identity type is the \"covenanted identity\" because it underpins the corporate brand. The covenanted identity comprises a set of expectations relating to an organisation's products/services and activities. Internally, it acts as a standard against which an employee/employer's actions can be evaluated. Argues that employees are crucial to the success, and maintenance, of corporate brands. Speculates that the current interest in corporate brands is redolent of a new dynamic in marketing. As such, corporate brands are symptomatic of the increased importance accorded to corporate‐level concerns and concepts. This interest in corporate‐level concerns should form the basis of a new branch of marketing: one that weft and weaves the concepts of corporate identity, image, reputation, communications along with corporate branding. The article concurs with Balmer and Greyser who argue that this area should be known as corporate‐level‐marketing."}]
