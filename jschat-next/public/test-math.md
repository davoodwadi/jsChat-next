\subsubsection{Choosing the Value of \(K\)}
and \(\text{df}_2 = g(K-1)\). The power \(1 - \beta\) is the probability that the non-central F-distribution \(F(\text{df}\_1, \text{df}\_2, \lambda)\) exceeds the critical value \(F_{\text{crit}} = F^{-1}(1 - \alpha; \text{df}\_1, \text{df}\_2)\) for significance level \(\alpha\).

Now let's do some

$$
E = MC^2
$$

or even

\[
E = MC^2
\]
