Third, the coefficient of the direct effect of review readability is negative, indicating that it is positively associated with product sales, as a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text (Korfiatis et al., 2012; Liu and Park, 2015). Although this result differs from the previous study (Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011), it is in line [...] First, our research reveals that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. This empirical finding is an important complement to the previous normative model of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context (Chen and Xie, 2008). This finding confirms the viewpoint of previous researchers: sellers are losing control over their brands and products (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010) because [...] To verify the proposed hypotheses, we assessed the path coefficients. The results are shown in Table 6 and are visualised in Fig. 8. Among the results, it is worth mentioning that the total indirect effect of product description informativeness (PDI) on product sales (LISR) is significant (0.023, p<0.001), while the direct effect of the same relationship is not significant (−0.016, p=0.162).

Two types of content coexist on modern e-commerce platforms like Amazon.com, called seller-created and buyer-created content. Extant literature suggests a range of factors that influence product sales on e-commerce platforms, including informativeness, [readability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/readability "Learn more about readability from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), multimedia richness, and extreme valence. However, interactions among the mentioned factors from both seller-created and buyer-created content remain to be empirically verified. This research embeds dual processing theory and dual coding theory as theoretical foundations in the conceptual framework, which determines the interrelationships among key drivers that affect product sales. To verify the hypotheses, we collected the data from Amazon (n = 5248) and estimated the empirical model using partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM). Among the results, it is highlighted that review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. While readability, multimedia richness, and extreme valence from buyer-created content exert both direct and moderating effects, the only factor from seller-created content that significantly affects product sales is multimedia richness. These findings confirm that, with the presence of customer reviews on product pages, sellers are losing control over the relevant information on their brands and products on the e-commerce platform: factors from buyer-created content are more directly influencing product sales. Nevertheless, sellers can still influence product sales by enhancing their content\'s informativeness and media richness.\n\n*   [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002193)\n*   [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002338)\n\nKeywords\n--------\n\ne-commerce\n\nSeller-created content\n\nBuyer-created content\n\nVideo games\n\nPLS-SEM\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\nE-commerce has been growing fast in recent years. Taking [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) as an example, the first-party e-commerce net scales on this platform have increased 3.2 times from 2014 to 2021 ([Statista, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib96)). During the [lockdown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/lockdown "Learn more about lockdown from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") caused by COVID-19, e-commerce accelerated its growth as new and existing customers chose to purchase products via available channels ([Barnes, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib8)). Therefore, it is not surprising to see that the net sales on [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) increased dramatically (1.4 times) in 2020 compared with 2019 ([Statista, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib96)). More importantly, given the early lessons from China ([Stewart, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib97)), post-COVID-19 consumers may be more willing to accept e-commerce as a purchase channel ([Barnes, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib8)).\n\nThe rapid development of e-commerce greatly impacts sellers’ marketing strategies. In the old years, customers were predominantly passive receivers of marketing and media information, and companies could avoid negative information because they almost completely controlled the brand-sharping messages ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). However, nowadays, companies have lost absolute control over the product information: consumers are using several portals to share comments and reviews about products or services, such as the comment area of online retailers and third-party channels ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). These new sources of information are essential for consumers when purchasing [experience goods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/experience-goods "Learn more about experience goods from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") like video games ([Zhu and Zhang, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib115), [2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)) because, for experience goods, it is relatively difficult and costly to obtain information on [product quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-quality "Learn more about product quality from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") before interacting with the product ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)).\n\nConsumers now find on e-commerce platforms two types of content, which are seller-created and buyer-created content ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20); [Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). In the social media context, these two types of content are also called marketer-generated and user-generated content ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Researchers have conducted a series of studies about their relationships to consumer behaviour and product sales regarding seller-created and buyer-created content.\n\nOn the side of buyer-created content, researchers have found that many determinants are associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. Several meta-analyses have been conducted to summarise the primary metrics of consumer reviews that affect product sales ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). Recent evidence suggests that review informativeness[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn1) is positively related to review helpfulness ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), which affects product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Informativeness, also called information richness, refers to the amount of information embedded in seller-created and buyer-created contents ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Moreover, readability ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), multimedia richness ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)), and valence ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)) of buyer-created content are positively associated with product sales. Additionally, researchers found that review valence moderated the relationship between review informativeness and [product evaluations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-evaluation "Learn more about product evaluations from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)).\n\nOn the side of seller-created content, researchers have found that information presentation of products is related to [mood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/mood "Learn more about mood from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), perceived risk, and purchase intention ([Park et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib87)). Meanwhile, vividness and interactivity are two critical components of information presentation in customers’ purchase patterns ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib61)). Besides, image-text presentation outperforms text-only presentation in terms of shorter information searching time on product listing pages ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)). Besides, media richness positively affects purchase intention through satisfaction with seller-created content ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)). Moreover, researchers found that high-quality product descriptions affected purchase intention through product involvement ([Mou et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib80)).\n\nSeller-created content and buyer-created content also jointly affect consumers’ trust ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27)), purchase intention ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)), purchase decision ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), and product sales ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Additionally, the psychological and informational distances between the two types of information affect review helpfulness ([Alzate et al., 2021a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib2)).\n\nDespite the rich theoretical and empirical evidence regarding the impacts of seller-created and buyer-created content on product sales on e-commerce platforms, several research gaps are noted. First, although the information from seller-created and buyer-created content could be complementary or substitutionary ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), the empirical evidence is scant. Second, although researchers speculated that more readable content enhanced the relationship between informativeness and product sales ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), the moderating role of readability is not empirically verified. Third, existing evidence suggests that multimedia richness affects purchase intention through the perception of consumer reviews ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)). Nevertheless, the relationship between multimedia richness and product sales remains explored. Forth, although researchers have found the moderating role of review valence between informativeness and product evaluations ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)), researchers still do not know whether the same moderating role exists between informativeness and product sales.\n\nTherefore, this research aims to verify:\n*   (1)whether the impacts of the informativeness in seller-created and buyer-created content (product description informativeness/review informativeness) on product sales are complementary or substitutionary. \n*   (2)the moderating role of the readability of seller-created and buyer-created content (product description readability/review readability) between the corresponding informativeness (product description informativeness/review informativeness) and product sales. \n*   (3)the moderating role of the multimedia richness in seller-created and buyer-created content (product multimedia richness/review multimedia richness) between the corresponding informativeness (product description informativeness/review informativeness) and product sales. \n*   (4)the moderating role of valence in buyer-created content (review valence) between the informativeness (review informativeness) in buyer-created content and product sales. \n\nTo achieve the mentioned goals, we created a conceptual framework combining the dual processing theory ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)) and the dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)), through which the hypotheses were proposed. To test the hypotheses in our conceptual framework, we collected data of video game products from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) using a third-party API service: the Rainforest API. Then, we operationalised the constructs and measured the variables, including creating the lexicons of video game attributes. Finally, we estimated the empirical model using partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM).\n\nThis research makes several contributions to the e-commerce literature as well as to practitioners and researchers in this field. On the theoretical side, our empirical findings suggest that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales, which complements the previous [normative model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/normative-model "Learn more about normative model from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). On the practical side, based on the empirical results, we provide concrete guidance for marketers to enhance their strategies on e-commerce platforms. Moreover, as an additional product of the research process, we developed the lexicons of video game attributes, which can help practitioners and researchers to understand and study the attributes of video game products.\n\n2. Theoretical background and hypothesis\n----------------------------------------\n\n### 2.1. Dual processing theory, dual coding theory, and conceptual framework\n\nIn [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") literature, scholars have used dual processing theory ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)) and dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)) to address a series of research issues. On the one hand, [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") researchers use dual processing theory to explore review helpfulness ([Bigne et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib15)), customers’ evaluation and recall ([Book et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib16)), and product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). On the other hand, dual coding theory is used to explore review helpfulness ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), review enjoyment ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), and examine product listing page design ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)). In the study, we used the mentioned two theories to construct our conceptual framework.\n\nThe dual processing theory in the [social psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/social-psychology "Learn more about social psychology from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") literature suggests two distinct processes in [human cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/human-cognition "Learn more about human cognition from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") that influence peoples’ attitudes: System 1 process and System 2 process ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). While System 1 is characterised as unconscious and perceptual, System 2 is conscious and analytic ([Evans, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib36)). Different authors have proposed distinct names for the two processes ([Evans, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib36)), and in line with some researchers ([Epstein and Pacini, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib34)), we call System 1 as experiential process and System 2 as rational process in this study. Marketing researchers have used dual processing theory to explain how informativeness and valence of consumer reviews affect product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)): while informativeness generates the rational process, valence generates the experiential process.\n\nSince consumers usually [face](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/face "Learn more about face from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") incomplete information when purchasing a product ([Kivetz and Simonson, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib66)), they rely on both seller-created and buyer-created content to reduce uncertainties ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). In this research, we classified the widespread informativeness on e-commerce platforms into two categories: product description informativeness from seller-created content and review informativeness from buyer-created content. While product description informativeness includes product-related information (e.g., introduction and specifications of the product), review informativeness contains customers’ experience of the product and e-commerce platform (e.g., product features and shopping experience) ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)).\n\nMoreover, consumers\' purchasing decision on e-commerce platforms is affected by the valence of the information received ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). Valence is the favourability, sentiment, and polarity in a piece of information, which can be either positive, negative, or neutral ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). On the one hand, consumers’ attitude towards a product is formed, reinforced, or altered from the exposure to positive or negative reviews from other consumers ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). On the other hand, although we acknowledge that there is a stream of research suggesting the positive effects of negative information ([Crowley and Hoyer, 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib29)), we assume that seller-created content always has positive valence on e-commerce platforms. In general, negative [marketing communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/marketing-communications "Learn more about marketing communication from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") is used to denigrate a product in an attempt to either discourage some attitude/behaviour or to establish some alternative attitude/behaviour ([Weinberger et al., 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib104)). Therefore, it is not an optimal strategy for retailers to place negative information about the product on the page where consumers place the order.\n\nDual processing theory explains the relationship between text information and product sales on e-commerce platforms. However, in many cases, there is not only text information but also multimedia information on the product page, such as images created by both sellers and buyers. To complete the conceptual framework, we embedded the dual coding theory. According to dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)), there are two ways that an individual could expand on learned material, which are verbal associations and visual imagery. Two cognitive systems are involved in processing textual and visual information. While the verbal system involves sequential processing following a certain direction, the non-verbal system involves parallel or synchronous processing, in which the available information is processed up to some limit. On the one hand, as both verbal and non-verbal systems can be activated without the other, they can be functionally independent ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). On the other hand, as one system can activate another, they also can be functionally interconnected ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). [Information system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/information-system "Learn more about Information system from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") researchers have applied the dual coding theory to explore the influence of product listing page design and sales ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)).\n\nConsumers make purchasing decisions relying on a combination of information stored in the memory and information that is available from current external cues ([Biehal and Chakravarti, 1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib14), [1983](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib13)). Moreover, the information may vary in media richness ([Maity and Dass, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib77)). Compared with text information, multimedia, including images and videos, present more realistic visual cues and dynamic movements for conveying product information, which is expected to have a powerful impact on consumers’ perception ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)).\n\n[Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig1) demonstrates the theoretical foundations, dual processing theory and dual coding theory, and the corresponding theoretical components: product description/review informativeness, product description/review [readability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/readability "Learn more about readability from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), product/review multimedia richness, and review valence. [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig1) also shows the sources that the theoretical components come from (Seller-created/Buyer-created content).\n\n![Image 11: Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr1.jpg)\n1.

Hypotheses\n\nThe following sections explain the relationships among the essential factors and product sales on e-commerce platforms before proposing the hypotheses. The hypotheses are visualised in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig2).\n\n![Image 12: Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr2.jpg)\n1.

Direct and mediating effects\n\nProduct information positively affects purchase intention through perceived quality and perceived value ([Chang and Wildt, 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib19)). Dual processing theory suggests that a deliberate and conscious [cognitive process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-process "Learn more about cognitive process from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") also influences peoples\' attitude formation ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). Cognitive content significantly impacts new product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). Additionally, previous empirical evidence suggests that the dimensions of informativeness, including information length ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Pan and Zhang, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib86); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)) and number of attributes ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98), [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), are positively associated with helpfulness, which is a critical component in consumers’ decision process when purchasing products ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Lee and Choeh, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib69); [Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). Thus, we infer that informativeness, whether from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H1a**\n\nProduct description informativeness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H1b**\n\nReview informativeness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nProduct description informativeness and review informativeness is correlated. Previously, researchers found that subjective norms were positively related to customers’ intention to write [online reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/online-reviews "Learn more about online reviews from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Dixit et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib32)). Subjective norms refer to the belief that an important person or group will approve and support a particular behaviour ([Ham et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib52)). Moreover, subjective norms are determined by the social pressure that individuals perceive when conducting certain behaviour ([Ham et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib52)). Therefore, as subjective norms are related to perceived social pressure, marketers\' initiatives not only increase the number of customer reviews but also increase the social sense of responsibility in review writing ([Dixit et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib32)). Thus, we infer that when seller-created content is more informative, customers perceive a social pressure that sharps their subjective norms when writing their reviews. The result of this behavioural process will be a more comprehensive and informative review. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formed:\n**H2**\n\nProduct description informativeness is positively associated with review informativeness on e-commerce platforms.\n\nWhile seller-created content is product-oriented, consumer-generated information is consumer-oriented ([Bickart and Schindler, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib12)). Therefore, buyer-created content is more relevant to consumers than marketer-generated information ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). Previous empirical evidence suggests that buyer-created content exhibits a stronger impact than seller-created content on consumer purchase behaviour ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Thus, we infer that, as the seller-created and buyer-created content coexist on e-commerce platforms, the effect of product description informativeness can be transmitted with the help of review informativeness. In other words, review informativeness partially or completely absorb the effect of product description informativeness on product sales. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formed:\n**H3**\n\nReview informativeness mediates the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nCustomer reviews should be precise and easy to understand without possible conflicts ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). In the e-commerce context, readability evaluates how easy it is to read and comprehend a piece of text information about the product ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67)). The readability of the text information reflects its author\'s social status, [education level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/education-level "Learn more about education level from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), and social hierarchy ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). The readability of a piece of information is positively associated with helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)). Meanwhile, the helpfulness of information influences product sales on e-commerce platforms ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Thus, we infer that the readability of the text content, no matter seller-created or buyer-created, is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H4a**\n\nProduct description readability is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H4b**\n\nReview readability is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nOn e-commerce platforms, multimedia, including seller-created and buyer-created images and videos, coexist with text content to convey important product information to consumers. Multimedia has a significant effect on individuals\' intention to visit websites ([Lu et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib75)), which eventually leads to purchase. Moreover, empirical results reveal that the number of images, such as foods and beverages, is positively related to review helpfulness ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), which further enhances product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Therefore, we infer that multimedia, from either seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H5a**\n\nProduct multimedia richness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H5b**\n\nReview multimedia richness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nApart from the conscious cognitive process, dual processing theory also suggests that unconscious and emotional process also influences peoples\' attitude formation ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). Valence is an indicator of a product\'s reputation and expected [product quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-quality "Learn more about product quality from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65); [Liu, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib73)). Positive reviews enhance consumers\' perceived quality and attitude towards the product, while negative reviews usually have an unfavourable impact on the attitude towards the product ([Liu, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib73)). Regarding the types of valence, on the one hand, researchers found that platform-related valence affected the trust in the seller ([Ba and Pavlou, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib6)). On the other hand, researchers found that product-related consumer reviews\' valence was significantly associated with mobile game sales ([Jang et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib60)). Additionally, existing empirical evidence from meta-analysis studies suggests that, in general, positive valence is positively associated with product sales, and negative valence is negatively associated with product sales ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). The influence of review valence is even more strong when the valence is extreme ([Hong et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib57)). Extreme valence refers to the evaluation that contains either extremely positive or extremely negative sentiment ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40)). Empirical evidence reveals that extreme rating leads to more helpfulness ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40)), which leads to higher product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Therefore, we infer that the proposition of extreme review valence is associated with product sales. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H6a**\n\nProportion of extreme negative valence in customer reviews is negatively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H6b**\n\nProportion of extreme positive valence in customer reviews is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n#### 2.2.2. Moderating effects\n\nThe readability of text content could influence its value ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). Information is easier to be processed and evaluated when it contains explicit statements ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)). Customers are “_cognitive misers_”, who take the easiest path to a solution, such as a purchasing decision, especially when they are goal-oriented ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)). The cognitive fit occurs when the information in the text matches customers’ own information-processing strategy ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67)). Cognitive fit suggests that, for the most effective and efficient problem solving to occur, the problem representation and any aids employed should support the strategies required to perform that task ([Vessey and Galletta, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib102)). Therefore, we consider that higher readability of the text information will trigger the cognitive fit of customers. The cognitive fit further leads to effective and efficient problem solving, which in the e-commerce setting is the purchasing decision. Thus, we infer that the readability of the text information, whether from seller-created or buyer-created content, empowers the connection between informativeness and product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H7a**\n\nProduct description readability strengthens the effect of product description informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H7b**\n\nReview Readability strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nA vivid product presentation offers consumers more informational cues about a product and stimulates more sensory channels than a pallid product presentation ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib61)). Generally, multimedia is used on e-commerce platforms to create vividness of product presentation ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib62)). Multimedia conveys non-verbal information using a richer set of symbol systems and, therefore, better preserves the original meanings, which reduces the chances of misinterpretation ([Lim et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib71)). According to dual coding theory, imagery stimuli are more likely to be coded visually and verbally, and text information is less likely to be coded visually ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). Thus, the dual coding process makes images easier to remember, generating the “Picture superiority effect”: visual information is more likely to be remembered than words ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). Moreover, “_the greater number of memory codes for images acts as multiple retrieval routes to those images, and therefore enhances information retention and recall_ ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58), p. 484, p. 484)”. Thus, we infer that the multimedia content, no matter seller-created or buyer-created, empower the connection between text information and product sales on e-commerce platforms. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H8a**\n\nProduct multimedia richness strengthens the effect of product description informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H8b**\n\nReview multimedia richness strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nApart from the direct effects of review informativeness and review valence on product sales, they may also interact. According to the [attribution theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/attribution-theory "Learn more about attribution theory from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), consumers may attribute emotions internally or externally ([Folkes, 1988](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib42)). While internal emotion refers to the personal disposition of reviews, external emotion refers to the reviewed product ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Researchers found that people tended to attribute other peoples\' negative behaviour internally and other peoples\' positive behaviour externally ([Zuckerman, 1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib116)). Therefore, whether consumers attribute reviewers’ emotions internally or externally depends on the review valence ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Empirical evidence revealed that negative valence in a single review tended to decrease its informativeness, making the evaluation less negative ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Following this analogy, we propose that positive valence in a review tends to increase its informativeness, which makes the evaluation more positive. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H9a**\n\nExtreme negative review valence weakens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H9b**\n\nExtreme positive review valence strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n### 2.3. Control variables\n\nApart from the potential relationships between the mentioned essential factors and product sales, previous empirical evidence suggests a series of other variables affecting product sales. In line with the previous empirical evidence, we included the following control variables in the empirical model: price ([Chevalier and Goolsbee, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib25); [Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)), product average rating ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Li et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib70)), product rating volume ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)), top review[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn2) rating variance ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [Wang et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib103)), summed amount of helpfulness in top reviews ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)), and top review volume ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)).\n\n3. Methodology\n--------------\n\n### 3.1. Data source\n\nWe collected data from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) (United States). Amazon data, including product descriptions (Seller-created content) and consumer reviews (Buyer-created content), were obtained using a third-party API: Rainforest API.[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn3) Amazon data was used because data from this e-commerce platform had been widely used in previous studies to explore the relationships between determinants and product sales ([Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Dhar and Chang, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib31); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Additionally, we focused on products in the video games category because video games are [experience goods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/experience-goods "Learn more about experience goods from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), which are relatively difficult and costly for customers to obtain information on their quality before interacting with them ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Therefore, reviews from other customers are especially important for buyers when purchasing experience goods ([Zhang et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib112)). Moreover, we selected the samples from the American site of Amazon because the United States was the largest video game market by global revenues, with $36.9 billion in 2009 ([Newzoo, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib82)). Driven by the growth in console game revenues, it overtook China for the #1 position ([Newzoo, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib82)).\n\nLike many other e-commerce platforms, Amazon samples some reviews that receive the highest helpfulness votes in the top review section of the product page. The mentioned approach saves consumers’ time in accessing quality reviews ([Saumya et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib93)). It is worth mentioning that, in this research, all the consumer reviews come from the top review section of the product page instead of including all reviews of a video game title. We only included top reviews of a video game title because it is difficult for consumers to go through all the reviews to make purchase decisions ([Singh et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib94)). According to [Brightlocal (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib17), 80% of consumers read less than ten reviews before trusting a product or service. Moreover, when a piece of [eWOM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/electronic-word-of-mouth "Learn more about eWOM from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") information is immediately visible and displayed in a structured way, it has a greater impact ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)).\n\n### 3.2. Data collection and data screening\n\nWe collected the data on July 2, 2021. On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), every product has a unique identifier called the ASIN code. We searched all the physical video game software (memory card or disc) in the following categories on Amazon: “PlayStation 4″, “PlayStation 5″, “Xbox One”, “Xbox Series X & S″, and “Nintendo Switch”. In this step, 9639 observations were found and included in the dataset. Due to network issues, sometimes the API returned duplicated observations with the same ASIN code. After screening out the duplicated observations, there were 9565 observations in the dataset. Moreover, due to the maintenance and other factors related to sellers, some product pages on Amazon did not contain the essential information, including ranking, product description, and price. Therefore, the mentioned observations needed to be further screened out, and 7717 observations remained in the dataset.\n\nIn this research, we only focused on the products with description in English, as it is the most commonly used language in the United States. Therefore, we screened out the observations in which the product description was written in non-English languages. To achieve this object, we used the Amazon Comprehend service,[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn4) a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. Commercial solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) require fewer or no training examples and less technical expertise to implement and calibrate the machine learning methods ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)). Specifically, in this case, we used the function of Language Detection, which automatically identifies text written in over 100 languages and returns the dominant language in the text with a confidence score. We first screened out the observations with confidence scores lower than 0.9 (7539 observations remained) and removed the observations in which the description was not written in English (7506 observations remained).\n\nThen, we removed the outliers in the dataset. The outliers should be removed from the dataset because the extreme values may have an unfavourable influence on the estimated results, even when using a robust method like partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM) ([Ghasemy et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib44); [Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). To remove the outliers, we conducted two operations. First, we removed the observations with the extraordinary price: either too low (less than $10) or too high (more than $100) because the products outside the normal price range suggest that they are not the regular retailing games in the market.[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn5) At this step, 6771 observations remained in the dataset. Second, we removed the observations without customer reviews (5271 observations remained) and applied a machine learning approach, isolation forest ([Liu et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib72)), to detect the multivariate outliers in the dataset. We set the sub-sampling size as 256 and the number of trees as 100, as these are the recommended parameters based on the previous empirical evidence ([Liu et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib72)). Then, we fed the algorithm on all the items that measure the variables and factors mentioned, which will be introduced in the following section. We screened out the observations with anomaly scores[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn6) larger than 0.65. Finally, 5248 observations remained in the dataset. [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl1) shows the whole data screening procedure.\n\nTable 1. Screening procedure.\n\n| Step | Operation | n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Original number of observations. | 9639 |\n| 2 | Remove the observations with duplicated ASIN code. | 9565 |\n| 3 | Remove the observations that: 1. Do not have the ranking information. 2. Do not have any product description. 3. Do not have the price. | 7717 |\n| 4 | Remove the observations with low language confidence score (<0.9). | 7539 |\n| 5 | Remove the observations in which the product description is not written in English. | 7506 |\n| 6 | Remove the observations with extraordinary price (less than $10 or higher than $100). | 6771 |\n| 7 | Remove the observations without customer reviews. | 5271 |\n| 8 | Remove the outliers. | 5248 |\n\n### 3.3. Operationalisation, measurement, and structural model\n\nRegarding the operationalisation of the theoretical components in our conceptual framework, in line with previous researchers ([Bergkvist and Rossiter, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib11)), we classified the components into two types: concrete singular components and abstract collective components. While the concrete singular component refers to the component with only one object to be rated, the abstract collective component is a set of concrete singular components that collectively form a higher-level theoretical category ([John R, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib63)). Thus, according to this classification, informativeness and valence belong to the abstract collective components, while readability, multimedia richness, product sales, and other control variables in our conceptual framework, are the concrete singular components.\n\nRegarding the operationalisation of the informativeness, there are different approaches in the literature, including information length ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Filieri et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib39); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Pan and Zhang, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib86); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)) and the number of attributes ([Nikolay et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib83); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)). However, according to the definition of informativeness ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), it is an abstract concept in nature, which implies that it is not directly observable, and we can only obtain indirect evidence of its relationship with other concepts through its operationalisation ([Podsakoff et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib89)). The ubiquitous one indicator approach of operationalising informativeness as a manifest variable in the literature may be conceptually deficient, as this approach fails to articulate all the essential properties of the concept. Therefore, in this research, we operationalised the concept of informativeness as a reflective latent factor, which captures the two dimensions in the content domain of the concept in the current literature.\n\nRegarding the measurement of the two indicators of informativeness, on the one hand, the information length was measured by the total number of words in a product description or consumer review. On the other hand, the number of attributes was measured by our self-developed lexicons (See [Appendix I](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1) for the developing process and [Appendix II](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1) for the developed lexicons). As for the specific data source of the two types of informativeness, we measured product description informativeness using the pooled text content from the purchase section (See [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig3)), the “From the manufacturer” section (See [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig4)), and the “Product description” section (See [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig5)). Similarly, we measured review informativeness using the pooled text content from the consumer review section (See [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig6)).\n\n![Image 13: Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr3.jpg)\n1.

Example of the content displayed in the consumer review section.\n\nTo measure the readability, we used a readability equation, the automated readability index (ARI) ([Smith and Senter, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib95)). The ARI was originally developed to measure the readability of written materials in the American [Air Force](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/air-force "Learn more about Air Force from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), which is positively associated with the educational grade level ([Smith and Senter, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib95)). We selected ARI to measure readability in this study because it was one of the most commonly used equations in academic research ([Zhou et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib113)). In the e-commerce context, a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)). The rationale behind this logic is that when a text can be easily comprehended by readers with fewer years of formal education, it implies that the text contains less complicated vocabulary, which makes it more readable ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)).\n\nAs for the operationalisation of review valence, researchers have quantified this concept in various ways ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). Some researchers used relative measures to quantify the valence, such as the ratio of one-star and the ratio of five-star rating ([Chen et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib22); [Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib26)), text sentiment ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), and hierarchical approach ([Eslami and Ghasemaghaei, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib35)). Due to the abstract definition and non-observable nature of valence, in line with the previous research ([Eslami and Ghasemaghaei, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib35)), we also operationalised extreme valence as a reflective latent factor. We used the ratio of five-star rating and the ratio of positive text sentiment to measure extreme positive valence, while we used the ratio of one-star rating and the ratio of negative text sentiment to measure extreme negative valence. To acquire the sentiment labels for the text, we used the Amazon Comprehend service.[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn7) Previous empirical results suggest that, compared with lexicon-based approaches (LIWC, in particular), machine learning methods significantly improve prediction accuracy ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)).\n\nRegarding multimedia richness, we measured this variable using the number of images from the seller-created and buyer-created content. Specifically, we measured product multimedia richness using the pooled multimedia content from the purchase section (See [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig3)), the “From the manufacturer” section (See [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig4)), and the “Product description” section (See [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig5)). Similarly, we measured review multimedia richness using the pooled multimedia content from the consumer review section (See [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig6)).\n\nTo measure product sales, we used the logarithmic inverse sales ranking of [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) as a proxy of actual product sales. The rationale behind this approach is that the log curves between sales ranking and actual product sales are approximately linear ([Chevalier and Goolsbee, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib25)). Besides, this approach is also in line with previous empirical studies, in which product sales on e-commerce platforms is the [dependent variable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dependent-variable "Learn more about dependent variable from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Alzate et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib3); [Chen et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib21); [Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Cui et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib30); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)).\n\nIn terms of the measurement of the control variables, we used the corresponding numerical data from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/).\n\n[Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl2) summarises the operationalisation, measurement, abbreviation, and description of the variables in the empirical model.\n\nTable 2. Operationalisation and measurement of the variables.\n\n| Concept | Operationalisation and measurement | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seller-created content | Product description informativeness (PDI) | ← | Information length (PDI1) | Total number of words in the seller-created text content. |\n| Number of attributes (PDI2) | Matching the seller-created text with the custom lexicons of video game attributes. |\n| Product description readability (PDR) | ← | Readability | Value of automated readability index (ARI) of the seller-created text content. |\n| Product multimedia richness (PMR) | ← | Number of images | Total number of images shown in the seller-created section. |\n| Buyer-created content | Review informativeness (RI) | ← | Information length (RI1) | Total number of words in the buyer-created text content. |\n| Number of attributes (RI2) | Matching the buyer-created text content with the custom lexicons of video game attributes. |\n| Review Readability (RR) | ← | Readability | Value of automated readability index (ARI) of the buyer-created text content. |\n| Review multimedia richness (RMR) | ← | Number of images | Total number of images shown in the consumer review section. |\n| Extreme negative review valence (ENRV) | ← | Ratio of one-star rating (ENRV1) | Ratio of one-star rating in the top review section. |\n| Ratio of negative sentiment (ENRV2) | Ratio of negative sentiment, returned by the Amazon Comprehend, in the top review section. |\n| Extreme positive review valence (EPRV) | ← | Ratio of five-star rating (EPRV1) | Ratio of five-star rating in the top review section. |\n| Ratio of positive sentiment (EPRV2) | Ratio of positive sentiment, returned by the Amazon Comprehend, in the top review section. |\n| Control variables | Price (PRI) | Video game price in US dollars. |\n| Product average rating (PAR) | Average rating of customer reviews in the product page. |\n| Product rating volume (PRV) | Total volume of customer reviews in the product page. |\n| Top review rating variance (TRRV) | Variance of customer review ratings in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Summed amount of helpfulness in top reviews (SAHTR) | Total volume of helpfulness in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Top reviews volume (TRV) | Total volume of customer reviews in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Dependent variable | Logarithmic inverse sales ranking (LISR) | A proxy variable of actual product sales using logarithmic inverse product ranking in the video game category. |\n\nThe empirical model is visualised in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig7). This figure demonstrates the measurement model of the variables and the structural model that specifies the hypothesised relationships between the variables and product sales.\n\n![Image 17: Fig. 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr7.jpg)\n1.

Visualisation of the measurement and structural models.\n\n### 3.4. Estimation method and software environment\n\nIn this research, we used PLS-SEM to estimate the empirical models that we proposed. PLS-SEM has become a quasi-standard in marketing and management research ([Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50)). PLS-SEM is suggested to be used when (1) the objective is to extend the existing theories; (2) the structural model is complex; (3) the research is based on secondary/archival data; (4) distribution issues are a concern. ([Ghasemy et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib44); [Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50), [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib51); [Sarstedt et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib92)). As the research purpose and the data characteristics of our study meet the mentioned points, PLS-SEM was used.\n\nIn terms of the software environment, we implemented the API application to obtain Amazon data from Rainforest API using Python in Spyder. Moreover, we called the requests from Amazon Comprehend and conducted the early data analysis using R in RStudio. We used the package _aws.comprehend_ to call the Amazon Comprehend API. Furthermore, we used SmartPLS to estimate the empirical model.\n\n### 3.5. Results\n\nThe [descriptive statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/descriptive-statistics "Learn more about descriptive statistics from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") for the items that measure the variables in the empirical model are summarised in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl3).\n\nTable 3.

Therefore, it is important to assess the measurement model before moving to the evaluation of the structural model ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Martínez-López et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib79)).\n\nPLS-SEM model assessment initially focuses on the measurement models, including the examination of internal consistency, [convergent validity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/convergent-validity "Learn more about convergent validity from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), and [discriminant validity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/discriminant-validity "Learn more about discriminant validity from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl4) summarises the results for the measurement model of the latent variables. According to the results, all the values of composite reliability and Cronbach\'s alpha are higher than 0.7, indicating desirable internal consistency ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). Moreover, the values of outer-loadings are higher than 0.7, while the values of average variance extracted (AVE) are higher than 0.5, indicating desirable convergent validity ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). Regarding the discriminant validity, we used both the Fornell-Larcker criterion ([Fornell and Larcker, 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib43)) and the Heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) ([Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)). While the Fornell-Larcker criterion is widely used in the literature to assess discriminant validity ([Hair et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib47)), HTMT is a more sensitive and reliable approach ([Ab Hamid et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib1); [Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)). [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl5) shows the correlation matrix with AVE. On the one hand, all the values of AVE are greater than the squared correlation estimates of the corresponding variables, which provides evidence for good discriminant validity according to the Fornell-Larcker criterion. On the other hand, to implement the HTMT approach, we first checked the HTMT values (See details in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1)). All the values are below the conservative threshold of 0.85 ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)), providing the initial evidence for good discriminant validity based on HTMT. Additionally, we conducted a bootstrapping procedure, which will be explained in the following paragraph, to conduct the formal statistical discriminant tests based on HTMT. According to the results (See details in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1)), none of the confidence interval includes the value 1, providing the further evidence for good discriminant validity.\n\nTable 4.

Therefore, the corresponding cells are presented with “N/A".\n\nAfter ensuring the reliability and validity of the construct measures, we moved to assess the structural model, which includes the examination of collinearity, size and significance of path coefficients, coefficient of determination (R 2), f 2 effect sizes, predictive relevance (Q 2), and global model fit ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). The mentioned results were returned from the bootstrapping procedure. We conducted the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) bootstrapping procedure (two-tailed testing and a significance level of 0.05) with the number of subsamples as 10000, which is in line with the suggestion in the literature: the number of subsamples should be higher than the number of observations (5248 in this case) ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)).\n\nRegarding the collinearity assessment, we checked the values of the variance [inflation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inflation "Learn more about inflation from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") factor (VIF) of the predictors. According to the results shown in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig8), all values of VIF are below the threshold of 5, which does not indicate the multicollinearity problem in the PLS-SEM context ([Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50)).\n\n![Image 18: Fig. 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr8.jpg)\n1.

Results of the estimation of [VIF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inflation "Learn more about VIF from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), R 2, loading, and path.\n\nTo verify the proposed hypotheses, we assessed the path coefficients. The results are shown in [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl6) and are visualised in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig8). Among the results, it is worth mentioning that the total indirect effect of product description informativeness (PDI) on product sales (LISR) is significant (0.023, p<0.001), while the direct effect of the same relationship is not significant (−0.016, p=0.162). These results suggest that a full mediated effect ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Nitzl et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib84)): review informativeness (RI) fully mediates the relationship between product description informativeness (PDI) and product sales (LISR). Thus, [H3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H3) is supported. Additionally, the direct effect (−0.154, p<0.001) as well as moderating effect (−0.139, p<0.001) of review readability (RR) are negatively significant. In line with the previous studies ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)), these results suggest that when the text of customer reviews requires fewer years of formal education to be understood, the reviews are associated with more product sales and also enhances the relationship between review informativeness (RI) and product sales (LISR). Hence, [H4b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H4b) and [H7b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H7b) are supported. Moreover, although the coefficients of [H6a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H6a) and [H8b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H8b) are significant, the signs are opposite to the hypothesised relationships. Therefore, the two mentioned hypotheses are not supported.\n\nTable 6.

Moreover, the values of f 2, which assesses the exogenous variables\' contribution to the endogenous variables’ R 2 value, are shown in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1).\n\nTo calculate the Q 2, in line with the literature ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)), we conducted the blindfolding procedure with the omission distance of 7. According to the results, the Q 2 value of product sales (LISR) equals 0.407, indicating a medium-high predictive relevance for the endogenous variables in the structural model ([Hair et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib48), [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib51)).\n\nIn terms of the global model fit, the standardised root mean residual (SRMR) is 0.096.[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn8)\n\n4. Discussion\n-------------\n\nIn this research, we used dual processing theory and dual coding theory as theoretical foundations to establish our conceptual framework, which helped determine the interrelationships among the key factors driving product sales on e-commerce platforms. To verify the hypotheses, we collected the data (n=5248) from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) and estimated the empirical model using PLS-SEM. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the highlighted results of this research.\n\nIn terms of the relationship between informativeness and product sales, we found that with the presence of customer reviews on product pages, review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. In other words, the influence of product description informativeness on product sales should completely pass-through review informativeness. Therefore, in contrast to earlier findings ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), the relationship between seller-created and buyer-created information is not simply complementary or substitutionary. Our finding suggests that review informativeness not only positively affects product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)) but also is positively influenced by product description informativeness.\n\nAs for the relationship between readability and product sales, several insightful results are found. First, the relationship between product description readability and product sales is insignificant. We infer that, quite possibly, like product description informativeness, the influence of product description readability on product sales is absorbed by customer reviews. Further work is required to explore the mentioned relationship. Second, the moderating role of product description readability in the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, as the direct relationship mentioned is not significant. Third, the coefficient of the direct effect of review readability is negative, indicating that it is positively associated with product sales, as a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)). Although this result differs from the previous study ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), it is in line with the results from other studies, which indicate that more readable texts generate a positive marketing outcome: they are positively associated with helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Reinartz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib90)). This discrepancy may be due to the explosive growth of customer review volume in e-commerce platforms in recent years leads to information overload, which forces customers to select reviews to read ([Alzate et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib3)). In this case, more readable reviews enjoy more helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Reinartz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib90)), which consequently leads to more product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Forth, the coefficient of the moderating effect of review readability is also negative. This result reveals another pathway by which review readability affects product sales: it enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales. Therefore, customers, as cognitive misers, employ not only readable reviews to assist their purchase ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)) but also find readable reviews with high informativeness valuable ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)), which finally drives purchase behaviour.\n\nMultimedia richness, either from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. This finding is in line with the previous findings ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), which indices that multimedia richness from customer reviews is positively associated with positive marketing outcomes, including review enjoyment and usefulness. Additionally, our results indicate that influences from the seller side do not fade completely: the seller-created multimedia content is still positively influencing product sales with the presence of customer reviews on product pages. Nevertheless, as the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, the moderating role of product multimedia richness is not found. Surprisingly, review multimedia reduces the influence of review informativeness on product sales. We speculate that, like review texts, images created by buyers also convey positive (e.g., the impressive graphic performance of a game) and negative valence (e.g., a broken package of a game). If images convey negative valence, they cloud eventually decrease the positive effect of review informativeness on product sales. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to further study the double-edged role of multimedia in customer reviews in future e-commerce studies.\n\nRegarding the valence of customer reviews, it is unanticipated that while the ratio of extreme positive review valence is not significantly associated with product sales, the ratio of extreme negative review valence is positively associated with product sales. A possible explanation for this is the defensive behavioural process ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)). Researchers found that customers with high self-brand connections consider negative brand information as a threat to their positive self-view ([Cheng et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib24)), and defensive purchase is a response: they counter-argued/derogated the message source and re-affirmed their own positive attitude ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)). Researchers have found a positive relationship between negative customer reviews and product sales in several product categories, including clothing, smartphones, hotel stay ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)), and books ([Berger et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib10)). As the mentioned positive relationship also exists in the video game context, it is possible that high self-brand connections ubiquitously exist in the population of video game players. Future studies on the current topic are, therefore, recommended. Moreover, in line with the previous study ([Cui et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib30)), negative reviews are more influential than positive reviews, which further supports the existence of the negativity bias ([Paul Rozin and Edward B. Royzman, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib88)) in the e-commerce context. Additionally, in contrast to earlier findings ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)), while the ratio of extreme positive valence enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales, the moderating role of the ratio of extreme negative valence is not found. A possible explanation for this is that video game players might generally have high self-brand connections, who attribute negative emotions internally to reviewers’ personal disposition rather than to the reviewed products.\n\n5. Implications\n---------------\n\n### 5.1. Theoretical implications\n\nThis research makes several theoretical contributions to the e-commerce literature.\n\nFirst, our research reveals that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. This empirical finding is an important complement to the previous [normative model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/normative-model "Learn more about normative model from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). This finding confirms the viewpoint of previous researchers: sellers are losing control over their brands and products ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)) because the information in the description they created can no longer directly influence product sales. Nevertheless, the situation is not so adverse: the text content that sellers create can still influence product sales with the help of information from customer reviews.\n\nSecond, previous empirical studies on the joint influence of seller-created and buyer-created content take place in either social media ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)) or the tourism ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)) context. In turn, our research is one of the pioneer studies to quantify the influences of both seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context. Therefore, the results of this research reveal better the economic value of the two types of content on e-commerce platforms.\n\nThird, we found that previous researchers either used dual processing theory ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)) or dual coding theory ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)) to approach their objectives in the e-commerce context. In contrast, our research highlights the necessity to combine both theories when studying various marketing phenomena in the e-commerce context. The reason behind this logic is that e-commerce platforms contain diverse components on the same product page, and omitting either theory may weaken the explainability.\n\n### 5.2. Practical implications\n\nThis research also makes several practical contributions to e-commerce markers and researchers.\n\nFirst, we used the bigram analysis to develop the lexicons of video game attributes. The developed lexicons help to understand and study the attributes of video game products, which have several practical applications, including product development, product maintenance ([Lawless and Civille, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib68)), [marketing research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/marketing-research "Learn more about marketing research from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), and video game research ([Bedwell et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib9); [Marlow et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib78); [Wilson et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib106)). For instance, with the assistance of our lexicons, researchers are able to conduct replication studies to verify whether the established knowledge from other contexts ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)) are applicable in the video game context, which is a process that is increasingly valued by marketing researchers ([Easley et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib33); [Evanschitzky and Scott Armstrong, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib37)). Moreover, our lexicons can also serve as a corpus that allows video game researchers to develop a more parsimonious taxonomy of video game attributes, which remains a research gap in the video game literature ([Marlow et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib78)).\n\nSecond, our results align with the viewpoint that sellers are losing control over their brands and products with the presence of customer reviews ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). Therefore, relying exclusively on markers’ own content may not be the most effective way to drive product sales ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Nevertheless, practitioners can still increase product sales by describing in detail their products, as the informativeness in product description increases the informativeness in customer reviews, which eventually drives product sales. Moreover, markers are encouraged to incorporate more images of their products on the product page, which directly drives product sales.\n\nThird, the results indicate that informativeness and readability of customer reviews are two crucial factors that drive product sales in e-commerce platforms. Therefore, markers should attach great importance to buyer-created content. In line with the suggestions from previous researchers ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), we also recommend practitioners implement an appropriate marketing initiative that combines seller-created and buyer-created content. Specifically, marketing managers are encouraged to consider developing customer incentive programmes like Amazon Vine,[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn9) in which the informativeness and readability in the reviews that participants write should be highly valued.\n\n6. Limitations and future research\n----------------------------------\n\nDespite the implications that this research offers, some limitations are identified.\n\nFirst, the empirical model of this research specifies the inter-relationships between the key components of seller-created and buy-created content that affect product sales. However, according to the standpoint of [social cognitive theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/social-cognitive-theory "Learn more about social cognitive theory from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Bandura, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib7)), individuals’ behaviour is not only influenced by environmental factors (which are included in this research) but also is influenced by personal factors (e.g., cognition, beliefs, skills, affects). Therefore, we encourage future researchers to extend our conceptual framework by incorporating [psychometric](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychometrics "Learn more about psychometric from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") factors, such as attitude and behavioural intention. This approach helps to reveal the [reciprocal interactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/reciprocal-interaction "Learn more about reciprocal interactions from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") among the three sets of influences in the e-commerce context.\n\nSecond, we observed the mediating role of review informativeness between product description informativeness and product sales. However, as this is an [observational study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/observational-studies "Learn more about observational study from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), it is not possible to estimate the causal effect of buyer-created content on product sales. The casual inference is important in the marketing discipline because researchers are interested in certain exposures to customer behaviour ([Varian, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib101)). Future researchers are encouraged to adopt the following approaches to make causal inferences for the results of our research. On the one hand, as randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard approach ([Austin, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib5)), it is recommended to replicate our study in the experimental setting. On the other hand, researchers can also use [propensity score matching](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/propensity-score-matching "Learn more about propensity score matching from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") to analyse the observational data to mimic some characteristics of a randomised controlled trial ([Austin, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib5)).\n\nThird, we detected the double-edged role of buyer-created images. We speculate that buyer-created images can also convoy positive or negative valence. Computer vision techniques have been used to automatically classify images on social media for [marketing research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/marketing-research "Learn more about marketing research from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Argyris et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib4)). Therefore, in future research, it is recommended to use deep learning algorithms to automatically classify the images with positive or negative valence and explore their relationships with product sales when the corresponding training set in the e-commerce context is available. Moreover, in line with previous researchers ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)), we also encourage future researchers to monitor closely the development of commercial cloud computing services, like the image classification algorithm of the AWS[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn10), which may be another solution to approach the research objective.\n\nForth, we focused on products in the video games category on the [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") platform. Products from the mentioned category are experience goods, which require sampling or purchase to evaluate the product quality ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Customer reviews are essentially crucial for buyers before purchasing experience goods like video games ([Zhu and Zhang, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib115), [2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)), which makes this product category adequate to study the mediating and moderating roles of the factors derived from both seller-created and buyer-created content. Nevertheless, the [sample selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/sample-selection "Learn more about sample selection from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") is double-edged. Customer reviews are expected to influence product sales only when consumers’ reliance on customer reviews is sufficiently high, which is further influenced by product characteristics ([Zhu and Zhang, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)). Therefore, although results in this research are expected to generalise to experience goods, future researchers are suggested to verify whether the results of this research are generalisable to search goods, such as digital cameras, laser printers, and [mobile phones](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mobile-phone "Learn more about mobile phones from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"). Unlike experience goods, consumers have the ability to obtain information on product quality before purchasing search goods ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Especially, researchers are encouraged to determine whether product type (experience/search goods) serves as a moderator between the essential factors and product sales in this research, as product type has been verified as an important moderator between various factors and the helpfulness of customer review ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40); [Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98)).\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n---------------------------------\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\n\nWe acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [Project number: [PID2019-108554RB-I00](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#gs1)] and the Public University of Navarre.

Therefore, sellers must convey quality cues that are readily identifiable to such consumers. However, thanks to major technological advances and the development of social interaction systems on e-commerce platforms, individuals can now access large volumes of information (reviews, opinions, ratings) posted directly by fellow consumers, which can also provide cues by which to judge product quality, pre-purchase. Based on dual-process theory and signaling theory, the objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the heuristic or systematic cues related to electronic word-of-mouth on consumer perceived product quality, to determine how this quality affects perceived product performance risk and consumer purchase intention. A quantitative approach was taken using a structured online questionnaire. Data were collected from 835 consumers of e-commerce platforms and analyzed using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling and LISREL software. The results show that the quantity of reviews, source credibility, review usefulness, and brand experience all exert a positive and significant effect on perceived product quality, which, in turn, positively and significantly influences purchase intention. A negative and significant relationship between product performance risk and purchase intention is also found. The findings contribute to the literature by improving our understanding of those determinants of perceived product quality in e-commerce that motivate consumers to make a purchase and can help sellers improve their use of integrated social interaction tools to adequately reflect the quality of their products.    \n*   ### [Importance and performance in PLS-SEM and NCA: Introducing the combined importance-performance map analysis (cIPMA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924000195)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract This research offers a novel approach that extends the application of importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) in partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) by incorporating findings from a necessary condition analysis (NCA). The IPMA comprises assessing latent variables and their indicators\' importance and performance, while an NCA introduces an additional dimension by identifying factors that are crucial for achieving the desired outcomes. An NCA employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for an outcome, while PLS-SEM follows an additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to high performance levels. Integrating these two logics into the performance dimension is particularly valuable for prioritizing actions that could improve the target outcomes, such as customer satisfaction and employee commitment. Although the combined use of PLS-SEM and NCA is a recent suggestion, this study is the first to combine them with an IPMA (i.e., in a combined IPMA; cIPMA). A case study illustrates the combined use of PLS-SEM and an NCA to undertake a cIPMA. This innovative approach enhances researchers\' and practitioners\' decision making, enabling them to prioritize their efforts effectively.    \n*   ### [How real-time interaction and sentiment influence online sales? Understanding the role of live streaming danmaku](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924000894)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract Live streaming danmaku can reflect both real-time interaction and user sentiment, two key characteristics of live streaming e-commerce. Using a sentiment analysis of live streaming danmaku comments, our study explores the mechanism through which user-user interaction influences live streaming sales. We collect real world data including live streaming danmaku, user stay time, sales from the Douyin live streaming e-commerce platform (the Chinese version of TikTok). Quantifying user-user interaction with BERT model, we then perform a sentiment analysis using the Baidu API. The results of our analysis demonstrate that entertainment-type and information-type user interaction have a significant positive effect on flow, including user stay time, number of danmaku, number of people sending danmaku. Our study also identifies that number of danmaku and number of people sending danmaku play a partial mediating role between user interactions and live streaming sales. Furthermore, we find that user sentiment plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between several flow variables and user purchase behavior. Theoretically, our study proposes a new method to empirically analyze user behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Practically, in light of these findings, we propose several optimization strategies to enhance the interaction functions of live streaming commerce, so as to enhance user experience and stimulate purchase intention.    \n*   ### [The importance of online customer reviews characteristics on remanufactured product sales: Evidence from the mobile phone market on Amazon.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923004289)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services Citation Excerpt : \nFilieri et al. (2021) used PLS-SEM to find the usefulness of online customer reviews had beneficial impacts on customers’ satisfaction using data from TripAdvisor. The empirical results of Cai et al. (2023) showed that review readability had a direct effect on the sales of products, and review informativeness plays moderating role. Previous literature also concentrated on the connection between online customer reviews\' emotion and purchase behaviors or product sales (e.g., Guo et al., 2020).   Show abstract Remanufactured products have emerged as an important option for achieving sustainable development, which is crucial to the success of the circular economy. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate the influence of online customer reviews on remanufactured product sales, an aspect that has not been well understood in current research. In this study, we employed natural language processing methodologies, analyzing over 50,000 reviews from 2020 to 2021 on Amazon.com to explore the impacts of online customer reviews on remanufactured product sales. The findings indicate that the formal characteristics of online customer reviews, that is, review length and review valence have positive influences on remanufactured product sales. Furthermore, the content characteristics of online customer reviews, including the volume and valence of product usability, product service quality, and product cost performance, positively promote remanufactured product sales. Additionally, this study reveals three emotional characteristics of online customer reviews that significantly influence remanufactured product sales. Specifically, contentment and surprise positively affect remanufactured product sales, while anger negatively affects remanufactured product sales. The findings of this study provide useful insights for remanufactured product sellers to manage online customer reviews and develop marketing strategies.    \n*   ### [Customization at a glance: Investigating consumer experiences in mobile commerce applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923003533)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services Citation Excerpt : \nTherefore, a comparison of opinions with each other within the same social group triggers SI. The identification among members with identical predilections significantly affects users to generate social presence, which in turn inclines them toward use behavior (Cai et al., 2023; Jaewon Choi, Lee, Sajjad and Lee, 2014). CUS based on social networking groups effectively provides recommendations from members to the target users (S. Li and Karahanna, 2012).   Show abstract The study strives to examine how customization (CUS) affects customers\' acceptance of m-commerce applications (MCA) and explore conditions where CUS would strengthen consumers\' behavioral intention (BI). The study aimed to bring insights for mobile commerce applications by testing the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) factors as mediators between customization and behavioral use. Our findings manifest that CUS positively impacts BI; this effect, meanwhile, has been partially mediated by the mediators illustrated in our model. Most importantly, all our evidence points out that CUS is key to understanding a customer\'s intention to adopt MCA. Unsurprisingly, products and services will be more helpful with CUS than with homogeneity in enhancing customers\' BI to adopt MCA. Indeed, CUS\'s effect on BI is mediated by a wide range of mediated factors. Our results indicate that UTAUT2 factors influence customers\' intentions to adopt MCA. Hence, this study considers it a significant value addition to the theory and practice.    \n*   ### [Return freight strategies and selling formats in e-commerce supply chain: The perspective of consumer fairness concerns and online shopping returns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923002400)\n\n2023, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract Returns and consumer fairness concerns put a huge pressure on manufacturers who sell their products online. The optimal selling format and return freight strategy become particularly important for manufacturers in an e-commerce supply chain. Therefore, we build game models for the following scenarios under different selling formats: the seller bearing the return freight costs or the return-freight insurance premiums, consumers buying insurance for themselves, and no one buying insurance. By comparing the optimal solutions of the game models under reselling and agency formats, several conclusions are derived. In the agency format, if the return-freight insurance premium is higher than a particular threshold, then the optimal strategy of the manufacturer is to decrease the selling price to encourage consumers to purchase the insurance, otherwise, the manufacturer should purchase the insurance. As the level of consumer fairness concerns and platform commission rates increase, the manufacturer should gradually move from the agency to reselling format. In the reselling format, if the return-freight insurance premium is lower than a particular threshold, then consumers will purchase insurance and this will make the platform more profitable, and conversely, the platform should bear the return freight costs.    \n\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-85138218423&md5=8550dee2cfdbbe7d58ea332aaf687d6)\n\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bfn1)\n\nIn this article, we call the informativeness embedded in buyer-created content as review informativeness, and that from seller-created content as product description informativeness.

Third, the coefficient of the direct effect of review readability is negative, indicating that it is positively associated with product sales, as a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text (Korfiatis et al., 2012; Liu and Park, 2015). Although this result differs from the previous study (Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011), it is in line [...] First, our research reveals that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. This empirical finding is an important complement to the previous normative model of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context (Chen and Xie, 2008). This finding confirms the viewpoint of previous researchers: sellers are losing control over their brands and products (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010) because [...] To verify the proposed hypotheses, we assessed the path coefficients. The results are shown in Table 6 and are visualised in Fig. 8.

Two types of content coexist on modern e-commerce platforms like Amazon.com, called seller-created and buyer-created content. Extant literature suggests a range of factors that influence product sales on e-commerce platforms, including informativeness, [readability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/readability "Learn more about readability from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), multimedia richness, and extreme valence. However, interactions among the mentioned factors from both seller-created and buyer-created content remain to be empirically verified. This research embeds dual processing theory and dual coding theory as theoretical foundations in the conceptual framework, which determines the interrelationships among key drivers that affect product sales. To verify the hypotheses, we collected the data from Amazon (n = 5248) and estimated the empirical model using partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM). Among the results, it is highlighted that review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. While readability, multimedia richness, and extreme valence from buyer-created content exert both direct and moderating effects, the only factor from seller-created content that significantly affects product sales is multimedia richness. These findings confirm that, with the presence of customer reviews on product pages, sellers are losing control over the relevant information on their brands and products on the e-commerce platform: factors from buyer-created content are more directly influencing product sales. Nevertheless, sellers can still influence product sales by enhancing their content\'s informativeness and media richness.\n\n*   [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002193)\n*   [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002338)\n\nKeywords\n--------\n\ne-commerce\n\nSeller-created content\n\nBuyer-created content\n\nVideo games\n\nPLS-SEM\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\nE-commerce has been growing fast in recent years. Taking [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) as an example, the first-party e-commerce net scales on this platform have increased 3.2 times from 2014 to 2021 ([Statista, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib96)). During the [lockdown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/lockdown "Learn more about lockdown from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") caused by COVID-19, e-commerce accelerated its growth as new and existing customers chose to purchase products via available channels ([Barnes, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib8)). Therefore, it is not surprising to see that the net sales on [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) increased dramatically (1.4 times) in 2020 compared with 2019 ([Statista, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib96)). More importantly, given the early lessons from China ([Stewart, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib97)), post-COVID-19 consumers may be more willing to accept e-commerce as a purchase channel ([Barnes, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib8)).\n\nThe rapid development of e-commerce greatly impacts sellers’ marketing strategies. In the old years, customers were predominantly passive receivers of marketing and media information, and companies could avoid negative information because they almost completely controlled the brand-sharping messages ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). However, nowadays, companies have lost absolute control over the product information: consumers are using several portals to share comments and reviews about products or services, such as the comment area of online retailers and third-party channels ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). These new sources of information are essential for consumers when purchasing [experience goods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/experience-goods "Learn more about experience goods from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") like video games ([Zhu and Zhang, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib115), [2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)) because, for experience goods, it is relatively difficult and costly to obtain information on [product quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-quality "Learn more about product quality from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") before interacting with the product ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)).\n\nConsumers now find on e-commerce platforms two types of content, which are seller-created and buyer-created content ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20); [Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). In the social media context, these two types of content are also called marketer-generated and user-generated content ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Researchers have conducted a series of studies about their relationships to consumer behaviour and product sales regarding seller-created and buyer-created content.\n\nOn the side of buyer-created content, researchers have found that many determinants are associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. Several meta-analyses have been conducted to summarise the primary metrics of consumer reviews that affect product sales ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). Recent evidence suggests that review informativeness[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn1) is positively related to review helpfulness ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), which affects product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Informativeness, also called information richness, refers to the amount of information embedded in seller-created and buyer-created contents ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Moreover, readability ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), multimedia richness ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)), and valence ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)) of buyer-created content are positively associated with product sales. Additionally, researchers found that review valence moderated the relationship between review informativeness and [product evaluations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-evaluation "Learn more about product evaluations from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)).\n\nOn the side of seller-created content, researchers have found that information presentation of products is related to [mood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/mood "Learn more about mood from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), perceived risk, and purchase intention ([Park et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib87)). Meanwhile, vividness and interactivity are two critical components of information presentation in customers’ purchase patterns ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib61)). Besides, image-text presentation outperforms text-only presentation in terms of shorter information searching time on product listing pages ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)). Besides, media richness positively affects purchase intention through satisfaction with seller-created content ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)). Moreover, researchers found that high-quality product descriptions affected purchase intention through product involvement ([Mou et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib80)).\n\nSeller-created content and buyer-created content also jointly affect consumers’ trust ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27)), purchase intention ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)), purchase decision ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), and product sales ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Additionally, the psychological and informational distances between the two types of information affect review helpfulness ([Alzate et al., 2021a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib2)).\n\nDespite the rich theoretical and empirical evidence regarding the impacts of seller-created and buyer-created content on product sales on e-commerce platforms, several research gaps are noted. First, although the information from seller-created and buyer-created content could be complementary or substitutionary ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), the empirical evidence is scant. Second, although researchers speculated that more readable content enhanced the relationship between informativeness and product sales ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), the moderating role of readability is not empirically verified. Third, existing evidence suggests that multimedia richness affects purchase intention through the perception of consumer reviews ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)). Nevertheless, the relationship between multimedia richness and product sales remains explored. Forth, although researchers have found the moderating role of review valence between informativeness and product evaluations ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)), researchers still do not know whether the same moderating role exists between informativeness and product sales.\n\nTherefore, this research aims to verify:\n*   (1)whether the impacts of the informativeness in seller-created and buyer-created content (product description informativeness/review informativeness) on product sales are complementary or substitutionary. \n*   (2)the moderating role of the readability of seller-created and buyer-created content (product description readability/review readability) between the corresponding informativeness (product description informativeness/review informativeness) and product sales. \n*   (3)the moderating role of the multimedia richness in seller-created and buyer-created content (product multimedia richness/review multimedia richness) between the corresponding informativeness (product description informativeness/review informativeness) and product sales. \n*   (4)the moderating role of valence in buyer-created content (review valence) between the informativeness (review informativeness) in buyer-created content and product sales. \n\nTo achieve the mentioned goals, we created a conceptual framework combining the dual processing theory ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)) and the dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)), through which the hypotheses were proposed. To test the hypotheses in our conceptual framework, we collected data of video game products from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) using a third-party API service: the Rainforest API. Then, we operationalised the constructs and measured the variables, including creating the lexicons of video game attributes. Finally, we estimated the empirical model using partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM).\n\nThis research makes several contributions to the e-commerce literature as well as to practitioners and researchers in this field. On the theoretical side, our empirical findings suggest that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales, which complements the previous [normative model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/normative-model "Learn more about normative model from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). On the practical side, based on the empirical results, we provide concrete guidance for marketers to enhance their strategies on e-commerce platforms. Moreover, as an additional product of the research process, we developed the lexicons of video game attributes, which can help practitioners and researchers to understand and study the attributes of video game products.\n\n2. Theoretical background and hypothesis\n----------------------------------------\n\n### 2.1. Dual processing theory, dual coding theory, and conceptual framework\n\nIn [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") literature, scholars have used dual processing theory ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)) and dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)) to address a series of research issues. On the one hand, [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") researchers use dual processing theory to explore review helpfulness ([Bigne et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib15)), customers’ evaluation and recall ([Book et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib16)), and product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). On the other hand, dual coding theory is used to explore review helpfulness ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), review enjoyment ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), and examine product listing page design ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)). In the study, we used the mentioned two theories to construct our conceptual framework.\n\nThe dual processing theory in the [social psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/social-psychology "Learn more about social psychology from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") literature suggests two distinct processes in [human cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/human-cognition "Learn more about human cognition from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") that influence peoples’ attitudes: System 1 process and System 2 process ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). While System 1 is characterised as unconscious and perceptual, System 2 is conscious and analytic ([Evans, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib36)). Different authors have proposed distinct names for the two processes ([Evans, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib36)), and in line with some researchers ([Epstein and Pacini, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib34)), we call System 1 as experiential process and System 2 as rational process in this study. Marketing researchers have used dual processing theory to explain how informativeness and valence of consumer reviews affect product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)): while informativeness generates the rational process, valence generates the experiential process.\n\nSince consumers usually [face](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/face "Learn more about face from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") incomplete information when purchasing a product ([Kivetz and Simonson, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib66)), they rely on both seller-created and buyer-created content to reduce uncertainties ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). In this research, we classified the widespread informativeness on e-commerce platforms into two categories: product description informativeness from seller-created content and review informativeness from buyer-created content. While product description informativeness includes product-related information (e.g., introduction and specifications of the product), review informativeness contains customers’ experience of the product and e-commerce platform (e.g., product features and shopping experience) ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)).\n\nMoreover, consumers\' purchasing decision on e-commerce platforms is affected by the valence of the information received ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). Valence is the favourability, sentiment, and polarity in a piece of information, which can be either positive, negative, or neutral ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). On the one hand, consumers’ attitude towards a product is formed, reinforced, or altered from the exposure to positive or negative reviews from other consumers ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). On the other hand, although we acknowledge that there is a stream of research suggesting the positive effects of negative information ([Crowley and Hoyer, 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib29)), we assume that seller-created content always has positive valence on e-commerce platforms. In general, negative [marketing communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/marketing-communications "Learn more about marketing communication from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") is used to denigrate a product in an attempt to either discourage some attitude/behaviour or to establish some alternative attitude/behaviour ([Weinberger et al., 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib104)). Therefore, it is not an optimal strategy for retailers to place negative information about the product on the page where consumers place the order.\n\nDual processing theory explains the relationship between text information and product sales on e-commerce platforms. However, in many cases, there is not only text information but also multimedia information on the product page, such as images created by both sellers and buyers. To complete the conceptual framework, we embedded the dual coding theory. According to dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)), there are two ways that an individual could expand on learned material, which are verbal associations and visual imagery. Two cognitive systems are involved in processing textual and visual information. While the verbal system involves sequential processing following a certain direction, the non-verbal system involves parallel or synchronous processing, in which the available information is processed up to some limit. On the one hand, as both verbal and non-verbal systems can be activated without the other, they can be functionally independent ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). On the other hand, as one system can activate another, they also can be functionally interconnected ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). [Information system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/information-system "Learn more about Information system from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") researchers have applied the dual coding theory to explore the influence of product listing page design and sales ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)).\n\nConsumers make purchasing decisions relying on a combination of information stored in the memory and information that is available from current external cues ([Biehal and Chakravarti, 1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib14), [1983](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib13)). Moreover, the information may vary in media richness ([Maity and Dass, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib77)). Compared with text information, multimedia, including images and videos, present more realistic visual cues and dynamic movements for conveying product information, which is expected to have a powerful impact on consumers’ perception ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)).\n\n[Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig1) demonstrates the theoretical foundations, dual processing theory and dual coding theory, and the corresponding theoretical components: product description/review informativeness, product description/review [readability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/readability "Learn more about readability from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), product/review multimedia richness, and review valence. [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig1) also shows the sources that the theoretical components come from (Seller-created/Buyer-created content).\n\n![Image 11: Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr1.jpg)\n1.

Hypotheses\n\nThe following sections explain the relationships among the essential factors and product sales on e-commerce platforms before proposing the hypotheses. The hypotheses are visualised in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig2).\n\n![Image 12: Fig. 2](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr2.jpg)\n1.

[Download: Download full-size image](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr2.jpg "Download full-size image")\n\nFig. 2. Visualisation of the hypotheses.\n\n#### 2.2.1. Direct and mediating effects\n\nProduct information positively affects purchase intention through perceived quality and perceived value ([Chang and Wildt, 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib19)). Dual processing theory suggests that a deliberate and conscious [cognitive process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-process "Learn more about cognitive process from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") also influences peoples\' attitude formation ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). Cognitive content significantly impacts new product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). Additionally, previous empirical evidence suggests that the dimensions of informativeness, including information length ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Pan and Zhang, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib86); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)) and number of attributes ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98), [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), are positively associated with helpfulness, which is a critical component in consumers’ decision process when purchasing products ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Lee and Choeh, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib69); [Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). Thus, we infer that informativeness, whether from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H1a**\n\nProduct description informativeness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H1b**\n\nReview informativeness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nProduct description informativeness and review informativeness is correlated. Previously, researchers found that subjective norms were positively related to customers’ intention to write [online reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/online-reviews "Learn more about online reviews from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Dixit et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib32)). Subjective norms refer to the belief that an important person or group will approve and support a particular behaviour ([Ham et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib52)). Moreover, subjective norms are determined by the social pressure that individuals perceive when conducting certain behaviour ([Ham et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib52)). Therefore, as subjective norms are related to perceived social pressure, marketers\' initiatives not only increase the number of customer reviews but also increase the social sense of responsibility in review writing ([Dixit et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib32)). Thus, we infer that when seller-created content is more informative, customers perceive a social pressure that sharps their subjective norms when writing their reviews. The result of this behavioural process will be a more comprehensive and informative review. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formed:\n**H2**\n\nProduct description informativeness is positively associated with review informativeness on e-commerce platforms.\n\nWhile seller-created content is product-oriented, consumer-generated information is consumer-oriented ([Bickart and Schindler, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib12)). Therefore, buyer-created content is more relevant to consumers than marketer-generated information ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). Previous empirical evidence suggests that buyer-created content exhibits a stronger impact than seller-created content on consumer purchase behaviour ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Thus, we infer that, as the seller-created and buyer-created content coexist on e-commerce platforms, the effect of product description informativeness can be transmitted with the help of review informativeness. In other words, review informativeness partially or completely absorb the effect of product description informativeness on product sales. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formed:\n**H3**\n\nReview informativeness mediates the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nCustomer reviews should be precise and easy to understand without possible conflicts ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). In the e-commerce context, readability evaluates how easy it is to read and comprehend a piece of text information about the product ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67)). The readability of the text information reflects its author\'s social status, [education level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/education-level "Learn more about education level from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), and social hierarchy ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). The readability of a piece of information is positively associated with helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)). Meanwhile, the helpfulness of information influences product sales on e-commerce platforms ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Thus, we infer that the readability of the text content, no matter seller-created or buyer-created, is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H4a**\n\nProduct description readability is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H4b**\n\nReview readability is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nOn e-commerce platforms, multimedia, including seller-created and buyer-created images and videos, coexist with text content to convey important product information to consumers. Multimedia has a significant effect on individuals\' intention to visit websites ([Lu et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib75)), which eventually leads to purchase. Moreover, empirical results reveal that the number of images, such as foods and beverages, is positively related to review helpfulness ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), which further enhances product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Therefore, we infer that multimedia, from either seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H5a**\n\nProduct multimedia richness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H5b**\n\nReview multimedia richness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nApart from the conscious cognitive process, dual processing theory also suggests that unconscious and emotional process also influences peoples\' attitude formation ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). Valence is an indicator of a product\'s reputation and expected [product quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-quality "Learn more about product quality from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65); [Liu, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib73)). Positive reviews enhance consumers\' perceived quality and attitude towards the product, while negative reviews usually have an unfavourable impact on the attitude towards the product ([Liu, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib73)). Regarding the types of valence, on the one hand, researchers found that platform-related valence affected the trust in the seller ([Ba and Pavlou, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib6)). On the other hand, researchers found that product-related consumer reviews\' valence was significantly associated with mobile game sales ([Jang et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib60)). Additionally, existing empirical evidence from meta-analysis studies suggests that, in general, positive valence is positively associated with product sales, and negative valence is negatively associated with product sales ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). The influence of review valence is even more strong when the valence is extreme ([Hong et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib57)). Extreme valence refers to the evaluation that contains either extremely positive or extremely negative sentiment ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40)). Empirical evidence reveals that extreme rating leads to more helpfulness ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40)), which leads to higher product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Therefore, we infer that the proposition of extreme review valence is associated with product sales. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H6a**\n\nProportion of extreme negative valence in customer reviews is negatively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H6b**\n\nProportion of extreme positive valence in customer reviews is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n#### 2.2.2. Moderating effects\n\nThe readability of text content could influence its value ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). Information is easier to be processed and evaluated when it contains explicit statements ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)). Customers are “_cognitive misers_”, who take the easiest path to a solution, such as a purchasing decision, especially when they are goal-oriented ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)). The cognitive fit occurs when the information in the text matches customers’ own information-processing strategy ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67)). Cognitive fit suggests that, for the most effective and efficient problem solving to occur, the problem representation and any aids employed should support the strategies required to perform that task ([Vessey and Galletta, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib102)). Therefore, we consider that higher readability of the text information will trigger the cognitive fit of customers. The cognitive fit further leads to effective and efficient problem solving, which in the e-commerce setting is the purchasing decision. Thus, we infer that the readability of the text information, whether from seller-created or buyer-created content, empowers the connection between informativeness and product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H7a**\n\nProduct description readability strengthens the effect of product description informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H7b**\n\nReview Readability strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nA vivid product presentation offers consumers more informational cues about a product and stimulates more sensory channels than a pallid product presentation ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib61)). Generally, multimedia is used on e-commerce platforms to create vividness of product presentation ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib62)). Multimedia conveys non-verbal information using a richer set of symbol systems and, therefore, better preserves the original meanings, which reduces the chances of misinterpretation ([Lim et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib71)). According to dual coding theory, imagery stimuli are more likely to be coded visually and verbally, and text information is less likely to be coded visually ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). Thus, the dual coding process makes images easier to remember, generating the “Picture superiority effect”: visual information is more likely to be remembered than words ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). Moreover, “_the greater number of memory codes for images acts as multiple retrieval routes to those images, and therefore enhances information retention and recall_ ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58), p. 484, p. 484)”. Thus, we infer that the multimedia content, no matter seller-created or buyer-created, empower the connection between text information and product sales on e-commerce platforms. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H8a**\n\nProduct multimedia richness strengthens the effect of product description informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H8b**\n\nReview multimedia richness strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nApart from the direct effects of review informativeness and review valence on product sales, they may also interact. According to the [attribution theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/attribution-theory "Learn more about attribution theory from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), consumers may attribute emotions internally or externally ([Folkes, 1988](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib42)). While internal emotion refers to the personal disposition of reviews, external emotion refers to the reviewed product ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Researchers found that people tended to attribute other peoples\' negative behaviour internally and other peoples\' positive behaviour externally ([Zuckerman, 1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib116)). Therefore, whether consumers attribute reviewers’ emotions internally or externally depends on the review valence ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Empirical evidence revealed that negative valence in a single review tended to decrease its informativeness, making the evaluation less negative ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Following this analogy, we propose that positive valence in a review tends to increase its informativeness, which makes the evaluation more positive. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H9a**\n\nExtreme negative review valence weakens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H9b**\n\nExtreme positive review valence strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n### 2.3. Control variables\n\nApart from the potential relationships between the mentioned essential factors and product sales, previous empirical evidence suggests a series of other variables affecting product sales. In line with the previous empirical evidence, we included the following control variables in the empirical model: price ([Chevalier and Goolsbee, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib25); [Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)), product average rating ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Li et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib70)), product rating volume ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)), top review[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn2) rating variance ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [Wang et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib103)), summed amount of helpfulness in top reviews ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)), and top review volume ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)).\n\n3. Methodology\n--------------\n\n### 3.1. Data source\n\nWe collected data from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) (United States). Amazon data, including product descriptions (Seller-created content) and consumer reviews (Buyer-created content), were obtained using a third-party API: Rainforest API.[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn3) Amazon data was used because data from this e-commerce platform had been widely used in previous studies to explore the relationships between determinants and product sales ([Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Dhar and Chang, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib31); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Additionally, we focused on products in the video games category because video games are [experience goods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/experience-goods "Learn more about experience goods from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), which are relatively difficult and costly for customers to obtain information on their quality before interacting with them ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Therefore, reviews from other customers are especially important for buyers when purchasing experience goods ([Zhang et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib112)). Moreover, we selected the samples from the American site of Amazon because the United States was the largest video game market by global revenues, with $36.9 billion in 2009 ([Newzoo, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib82)). Driven by the growth in console game revenues, it overtook China for the #1 position ([Newzoo, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib82)).\n\nLike many other e-commerce platforms, Amazon samples some reviews that receive the highest helpfulness votes in the top review section of the product page. The mentioned approach saves consumers’ time in accessing quality reviews ([Saumya et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib93)). It is worth mentioning that, in this research, all the consumer reviews come from the top review section of the product page instead of including all reviews of a video game title. We only included top reviews of a video game title because it is difficult for consumers to go through all the reviews to make purchase decisions ([Singh et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib94)). According to [Brightlocal (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib17), 80% of consumers read less than ten reviews before trusting a product or service. Moreover, when a piece of [eWOM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/electronic-word-of-mouth "Learn more about eWOM from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") information is immediately visible and displayed in a structured way, it has a greater impact ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)).\n\n### 3.2. Data collection and data screening\n\nWe collected the data on July 2, 2021. On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), every product has a unique identifier called the ASIN code. We searched all the physical video game software (memory card or disc) in the following categories on Amazon: “PlayStation 4″, “PlayStation 5″, “Xbox One”, “Xbox Series X & S″, and “Nintendo Switch”. In this step, 9639 observations were found and included in the dataset. Due to network issues, sometimes the API returned duplicated observations with the same ASIN code. After screening out the duplicated observations, there were 9565 observations in the dataset. Moreover, due to the maintenance and other factors related to sellers, some product pages on Amazon did not contain the essential information, including ranking, product description, and price. Therefore, the mentioned observations needed to be further screened out, and 7717 observations remained in the dataset.\n\nIn this research, we only focused on the products with description in English, as it is the most commonly used language in the United States. Therefore, we screened out the observations in which the product description was written in non-English languages. To achieve this object, we used the Amazon Comprehend service,[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn4) a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. Commercial solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) require fewer or no training examples and less technical expertise to implement and calibrate the machine learning methods ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)). Specifically, in this case, we used the function of Language Detection, which automatically identifies text written in over 100 languages and returns the dominant language in the text with a confidence score. We first screened out the observations with confidence scores lower than 0.9 (7539 observations remained) and removed the observations in which the description was not written in English (7506 observations remained).\n\nThen, we removed the outliers in the dataset. The outliers should be removed from the dataset because the extreme values may have an unfavourable influence on the estimated results, even when using a robust method like partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM) ([Ghasemy et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib44); [Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). To remove the outliers, we conducted two operations. First, we removed the observations with the extraordinary price: either too low (less than $10) or too high (more than $100) because the products outside the normal price range suggest that they are not the regular retailing games in the market.[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn5) At this step, 6771 observations remained in the dataset. Second, we removed the observations without customer reviews (5271 observations remained) and applied a machine learning approach, isolation forest ([Liu et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib72)), to detect the multivariate outliers in the dataset. We set the sub-sampling size as 256 and the number of trees as 100, as these are the recommended parameters based on the previous empirical evidence ([Liu et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib72)). Then, we fed the algorithm on all the items that measure the variables and factors mentioned, which will be introduced in the following section. We screened out the observations with anomaly scores[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn6) larger than 0.65. Finally, 5248 observations remained in the dataset. [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl1) shows the whole data screening procedure.\n\nTable 1. Screening procedure.\n\n| Step | Operation | n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Original number of observations. | 9639 |\n| 2 | Remove the observations with duplicated ASIN code. | 9565 |\n| 3 | Remove the observations that: 1. Do not have the ranking information. 2. Do not have any product description. 3. Do not have the price. | 7717 |\n| 4 | Remove the observations with low language confidence score (<0.9). | 7539 |\n| 5 | Remove the observations in which the product description is not written in English. | 7506 |\n| 6 | Remove the observations with extraordinary price (less than $10 or higher than $100). | 6771 |\n| 7 | Remove the observations without customer reviews. | 5271 |\n| 8 | Remove the outliers. | 5248 |\n\n### 3.3. Operationalisation, measurement, and structural model\n\nRegarding the operationalisation of the theoretical components in our conceptual framework, in line with previous researchers ([Bergkvist and Rossiter, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib11)), we classified the components into two types: concrete singular components and abstract collective components. While the concrete singular component refers to the component with only one object to be rated, the abstract collective component is a set of concrete singular components that collectively form a higher-level theoretical category ([John R, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib63)). Thus, according to this classification, informativeness and valence belong to the abstract collective components, while readability, multimedia richness, product sales, and other control variables in our conceptual framework, are the concrete singular components.\n\nRegarding the operationalisation of the informativeness, there are different approaches in the literature, including information length ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Filieri et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib39); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Pan and Zhang, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib86); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)) and the number of attributes ([Nikolay et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib83); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)). However, according to the definition of informativeness ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), it is an abstract concept in nature, which implies that it is not directly observable, and we can only obtain indirect evidence of its relationship with other concepts through its operationalisation ([Podsakoff et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib89)). The ubiquitous one indicator approach of operationalising informativeness as a manifest variable in the literature may be conceptually deficient, as this approach fails to articulate all the essential properties of the concept. Therefore, in this research, we operationalised the concept of informativeness as a reflective latent factor, which captures the two dimensions in the content domain of the concept in the current literature.\n\nRegarding the measurement of the two indicators of informativeness, on the one hand, the information length was measured by the total number of words in a product description or consumer review. On the other hand, the number of attributes was measured by our self-developed lexicons (See [Appendix I](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1) for the developing process and [Appendix II](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1) for the developed lexicons). As for the specific data source of the two types of informativeness, we measured product description informativeness using the pooled text content from the purchase section (See [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig3)), the “From the manufacturer” section (See [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig4)), and the “Product description” section (See [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig5)). Similarly, we measured review informativeness using the pooled text content from the consumer review section (See [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig6)).\n\n![Image 13: Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr3.jpg)\n1.

Example of the content displayed in the consumer review section.\n\nTo measure the readability, we used a readability equation, the automated readability index (ARI) ([Smith and Senter, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib95)). The ARI was originally developed to measure the readability of written materials in the American [Air Force](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/air-force "Learn more about Air Force from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), which is positively associated with the educational grade level ([Smith and Senter, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib95)). We selected ARI to measure readability in this study because it was one of the most commonly used equations in academic research ([Zhou et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib113)). In the e-commerce context, a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)). The rationale behind this logic is that when a text can be easily comprehended by readers with fewer years of formal education, it implies that the text contains less complicated vocabulary, which makes it more readable ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)).\n\nAs for the operationalisation of review valence, researchers have quantified this concept in various ways ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). Some researchers used relative measures to quantify the valence, such as the ratio of one-star and the ratio of five-star rating ([Chen et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib22); [Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib26)), text sentiment ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), and hierarchical approach ([Eslami and Ghasemaghaei, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib35)). Due to the abstract definition and non-observable nature of valence, in line with the previous research ([Eslami and Ghasemaghaei, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib35)), we also operationalised extreme valence as a reflective latent factor. We used the ratio of five-star rating and the ratio of positive text sentiment to measure extreme positive valence, while we used the ratio of one-star rating and the ratio of negative text sentiment to measure extreme negative valence. To acquire the sentiment labels for the text, we used the Amazon Comprehend service.[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn7) Previous empirical results suggest that, compared with lexicon-based approaches (LIWC, in particular), machine learning methods significantly improve prediction accuracy ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)).\n\nRegarding multimedia richness, we measured this variable using the number of images from the seller-created and buyer-created content. Specifically, we measured product multimedia richness using the pooled multimedia content from the purchase section (See [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig3)), the “From the manufacturer” section (See [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig4)), and the “Product description” section (See [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig5)). Similarly, we measured review multimedia richness using the pooled multimedia content from the consumer review section (See [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig6)).\n\nTo measure product sales, we used the logarithmic inverse sales ranking of [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) as a proxy of actual product sales. The rationale behind this approach is that the log curves between sales ranking and actual product sales are approximately linear ([Chevalier and Goolsbee, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib25)). Besides, this approach is also in line with previous empirical studies, in which product sales on e-commerce platforms is the [dependent variable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dependent-variable "Learn more about dependent variable from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Alzate et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib3); [Chen et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib21); [Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Cui et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib30); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)).\n\nIn terms of the measurement of the control variables, we used the corresponding numerical data from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/).\n\n[Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl2) summarises the operationalisation, measurement, abbreviation, and description of the variables in the empirical model.\n\nTable 2. Operationalisation and measurement of the variables.\n\n| Concept | Operationalisation and measurement | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seller-created content | Product description informativeness (PDI) | ← | Information length (PDI1) | Total number of words in the seller-created text content. |\n| Number of attributes (PDI2) | Matching the seller-created text with the custom lexicons of video game attributes. |\n| Product description readability (PDR) | ← | Readability | Value of automated readability index (ARI) of the seller-created text content. |\n| Product multimedia richness (PMR) | ← | Number of images | Total number of images shown in the seller-created section. |\n| Buyer-created content | Review informativeness (RI) | ← | Information length (RI1) | Total number of words in the buyer-created text content. |\n| Number of attributes (RI2) | Matching the buyer-created text content with the custom lexicons of video game attributes. |\n| Review Readability (RR) | ← | Readability | Value of automated readability index (ARI) of the buyer-created text content. |\n| Review multimedia richness (RMR) | ← | Number of images | Total number of images shown in the consumer review section. |\n| Extreme negative review valence (ENRV) | ← | Ratio of one-star rating (ENRV1) | Ratio of one-star rating in the top review section. |\n| Ratio of negative sentiment (ENRV2) | Ratio of negative sentiment, returned by the Amazon Comprehend, in the top review section. |\n| Extreme positive review valence (EPRV) | ← | Ratio of five-star rating (EPRV1) | Ratio of five-star rating in the top review section. |\n| Ratio of positive sentiment (EPRV2) | Ratio of positive sentiment, returned by the Amazon Comprehend, in the top review section. |\n| Control variables | Price (PRI) | Video game price in US dollars. |\n| Product average rating (PAR) | Average rating of customer reviews in the product page. |\n| Product rating volume (PRV) | Total volume of customer reviews in the product page. |\n| Top review rating variance (TRRV) | Variance of customer review ratings in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Summed amount of helpfulness in top reviews (SAHTR) | Total volume of helpfulness in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Top reviews volume (TRV) | Total volume of customer reviews in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Dependent variable | Logarithmic inverse sales ranking (LISR) | A proxy variable of actual product sales using logarithmic inverse product ranking in the video game category. |\n\nThe empirical model is visualised in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig7). This figure demonstrates the measurement model of the variables and the structural model that specifies the hypothesised relationships between the variables and product sales.\n\n![Image 17: Fig. 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr7.jpg)\n1.

Visualisation of the measurement and structural models.\n\n### 3.4. Estimation method and software environment\n\nIn this research, we used PLS-SEM to estimate the empirical models that we proposed. PLS-SEM has become a quasi-standard in marketing and management research ([Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50)). PLS-SEM is suggested to be used when (1) the objective is to extend the existing theories; (2) the structural model is complex; (3) the research is based on secondary/archival data; (4) distribution issues are a concern. ([Ghasemy et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib44); [Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50), [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib51); [Sarstedt et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib92)). As the research purpose and the data characteristics of our study meet the mentioned points, PLS-SEM was used.\n\nIn terms of the software environment, we implemented the API application to obtain Amazon data from Rainforest API using Python in Spyder. Moreover, we called the requests from Amazon Comprehend and conducted the early data analysis using R in RStudio. We used the package _aws.comprehend_ to call the Amazon Comprehend API. Furthermore, we used SmartPLS to estimate the empirical model.\n\n### 3.5. Results\n\nThe [descriptive statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/descriptive-statistics "Learn more about descriptive statistics from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") for the items that measure the variables in the empirical model are summarised in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl3).\n\nTable 3.

Therefore, it is important to assess the measurement model before moving to the evaluation of the structural model ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Martínez-López et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib79)).\n\nPLS-SEM model assessment initially focuses on the measurement models, including the examination of internal consistency, [convergent validity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/convergent-validity "Learn more about convergent validity from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), and [discriminant validity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/discriminant-validity "Learn more about discriminant validity from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl4) summarises the results for the measurement model of the latent variables. According to the results, all the values of composite reliability and Cronbach\'s alpha are higher than 0.7, indicating desirable internal consistency ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). Moreover, the values of outer-loadings are higher than 0.7, while the values of average variance extracted (AVE) are higher than 0.5, indicating desirable convergent validity ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). Regarding the discriminant validity, we used both the Fornell-Larcker criterion ([Fornell and Larcker, 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib43)) and the Heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) ([Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)). While the Fornell-Larcker criterion is widely used in the literature to assess discriminant validity ([Hair et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib47)), HTMT is a more sensitive and reliable approach ([Ab Hamid et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib1); [Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)). [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl5) shows the correlation matrix with AVE. On the one hand, all the values of AVE are greater than the squared correlation estimates of the corresponding variables, which provides evidence for good discriminant validity according to the Fornell-Larcker criterion. On the other hand, to implement the HTMT approach, we first checked the HTMT values (See details in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1)). All the values are below the conservative threshold of 0.85 ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)), providing the initial evidence for good discriminant validity based on HTMT. Additionally, we conducted a bootstrapping procedure, which will be explained in the following paragraph, to conduct the formal statistical discriminant tests based on HTMT. According to the results (See details in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1)), none of the confidence interval includes the value 1, providing the further evidence for good discriminant validity.\n\nTable 4.

Therefore, the corresponding cells are presented with “N/A".\n\nAfter ensuring the reliability and validity of the construct measures, we moved to assess the structural model, which includes the examination of collinearity, size and significance of path coefficients, coefficient of determination (R 2), f 2 effect sizes, predictive relevance (Q 2), and global model fit ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). The mentioned results were returned from the bootstrapping procedure. We conducted the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) bootstrapping procedure (two-tailed testing and a significance level of 0.05) with the number of subsamples as 10000, which is in line with the suggestion in the literature: the number of subsamples should be higher than the number of observations (5248 in this case) ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)).\n\nRegarding the collinearity assessment, we checked the values of the variance [inflation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inflation "Learn more about inflation from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") factor (VIF) of the predictors. According to the results shown in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig8), all values of VIF are below the threshold of 5, which does not indicate the multicollinearity problem in the PLS-SEM context ([Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50)).\n\n![Image 18: Fig. 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr8.jpg)\n1.

Results of the estimation of [VIF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inflation "Learn more about VIF from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), R 2, loading, and path.\n\nTo verify the proposed hypotheses, we assessed the path coefficients. The results are shown in [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl6) and are visualised in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig8). Among the results, it is worth mentioning that the total indirect effect of product description informativeness (PDI) on product sales (LISR) is significant (0.023, p<0.001), while the direct effect of the same relationship is not significant (−0.016, p=0.162). These results suggest that a full mediated effect ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Nitzl et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib84)): review informativeness (RI) fully mediates the relationship between product description informativeness (PDI) and product sales (LISR). Thus, [H3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H3) is supported. Additionally, the direct effect (−0.154, p<0.001) as well as moderating effect (−0.139, p<0.001) of review readability (RR) are negatively significant. In line with the previous studies ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)), these results suggest that when the text of customer reviews requires fewer years of formal education to be understood, the reviews are associated with more product sales and also enhances the relationship between review informativeness (RI) and product sales (LISR). Hence, [H4b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H4b) and [H7b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H7b) are supported. Moreover, although the coefficients of [H6a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H6a) and [H8b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H8b) are significant, the signs are opposite to the hypothesised relationships. Therefore, the two mentioned hypotheses are not supported.\n\nTable 6.

Moreover, the values of f 2, which assesses the exogenous variables\' contribution to the endogenous variables’ R 2 value, are shown in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1).\n\nTo calculate the Q 2, in line with the literature ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)), we conducted the blindfolding procedure with the omission distance of 7. According to the results, the Q 2 value of product sales (LISR) equals 0.407, indicating a medium-high predictive relevance for the endogenous variables in the structural model ([Hair et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib48), [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib51)).\n\nIn terms of the global model fit, the standardised root mean residual (SRMR) is 0.096.[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn8)\n\n4. Discussion\n-------------\n\nIn this research, we used dual processing theory and dual coding theory as theoretical foundations to establish our conceptual framework, which helped determine the interrelationships among the key factors driving product sales on e-commerce platforms. To verify the hypotheses, we collected the data (n=5248) from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) and estimated the empirical model using PLS-SEM. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the highlighted results of this research.\n\nIn terms of the relationship between informativeness and product sales, we found that with the presence of customer reviews on product pages, review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. In other words, the influence of product description informativeness on product sales should completely pass-through review informativeness. Therefore, in contrast to earlier findings ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), the relationship between seller-created and buyer-created information is not simply complementary or substitutionary. Our finding suggests that review informativeness not only positively affects product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)) but also is positively influenced by product description informativeness.\n\nAs for the relationship between readability and product sales, several insightful results are found. First, the relationship between product description readability and product sales is insignificant. We infer that, quite possibly, like product description informativeness, the influence of product description readability on product sales is absorbed by customer reviews. Further work is required to explore the mentioned relationship. Second, the moderating role of product description readability in the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, as the direct relationship mentioned is not significant. Third, the coefficient of the direct effect of review readability is negative, indicating that it is positively associated with product sales, as a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)). Although this result differs from the previous study ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), it is in line with the results from other studies, which indicate that more readable texts generate a positive marketing outcome: they are positively associated with helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Reinartz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib90)). This discrepancy may be due to the explosive growth of customer review volume in e-commerce platforms in recent years leads to information overload, which forces customers to select reviews to read ([Alzate et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib3)). In this case, more readable reviews enjoy more helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Reinartz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib90)), which consequently leads to more product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Forth, the coefficient of the moderating effect of review readability is also negative. This result reveals another pathway by which review readability affects product sales: it enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales. Therefore, customers, as cognitive misers, employ not only readable reviews to assist their purchase ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)) but also find readable reviews with high informativeness valuable ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)), which finally drives purchase behaviour.\n\nMultimedia richness, either from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. This finding is in line with the previous findings ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), which indices that multimedia richness from customer reviews is positively associated with positive marketing outcomes, including review enjoyment and usefulness. Additionally, our results indicate that influences from the seller side do not fade completely: the seller-created multimedia content is still positively influencing product sales with the presence of customer reviews on product pages. Nevertheless, as the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, the moderating role of product multimedia richness is not found. Surprisingly, review multimedia reduces the influence of review informativeness on product sales. We speculate that, like review texts, images created by buyers also convey positive (e.g., the impressive graphic performance of a game) and negative valence (e.g., a broken package of a game). If images convey negative valence, they cloud eventually decrease the positive effect of review informativeness on product sales. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to further study the double-edged role of multimedia in customer reviews in future e-commerce studies.\n\nRegarding the valence of customer reviews, it is unanticipated that while the ratio of extreme positive review valence is not significantly associated with product sales, the ratio of extreme negative review valence is positively associated with product sales. A possible explanation for this is the defensive behavioural process ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)). Researchers found that customers with high self-brand connections consider negative brand information as a threat to their positive self-view ([Cheng et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib24)), and defensive purchase is a response: they counter-argued/derogated the message source and re-affirmed their own positive attitude ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)). Researchers have found a positive relationship between negative customer reviews and product sales in several product categories, including clothing, smartphones, hotel stay ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)), and books ([Berger et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib10)). As the mentioned positive relationship also exists in the video game context, it is possible that high self-brand connections ubiquitously exist in the population of video game players. Future studies on the current topic are, therefore, recommended. Moreover, in line with the previous study ([Cui et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib30)), negative reviews are more influential than positive reviews, which further supports the existence of the negativity bias ([Paul Rozin and Edward B. Royzman, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib88)) in the e-commerce context. Additionally, in contrast to earlier findings ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)), while the ratio of extreme positive valence enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales, the moderating role of the ratio of extreme negative valence is not found. A possible explanation for this is that video game players might generally have high self-brand connections, who attribute negative emotions internally to reviewers’ personal disposition rather than to the reviewed products.\n\n5. Implications\n---------------\n\n### 5.1. Theoretical implications\n\nThis research makes several theoretical contributions to the e-commerce literature.\n\nFirst, our research reveals that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. This empirical finding is an important complement to the previous [normative model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/normative-model "Learn more about normative model from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). This finding confirms the viewpoint of previous researchers: sellers are losing control over their brands and products ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)) because the information in the description they created can no longer directly influence product sales. Nevertheless, the situation is not so adverse: the text content that sellers create can still influence product sales with the help of information from customer reviews.\n\nSecond, previous empirical studies on the joint influence of seller-created and buyer-created content take place in either social media ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)) or the tourism ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)) context. In turn, our research is one of the pioneer studies to quantify the influences of both seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context. Therefore, the results of this research reveal better the economic value of the two types of content on e-commerce platforms.\n\nThird, we found that previous researchers either used dual processing theory ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)) or dual coding theory ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)) to approach their objectives in the e-commerce context. In contrast, our research highlights the necessity to combine both theories when studying various marketing phenomena in the e-commerce context. The reason behind this logic is that e-commerce platforms contain diverse components on the same product page, and omitting either theory may weaken the explainability.\n\n### 5.2. Practical implications\n\nThis research also makes several practical contributions to e-commerce markers and researchers.\n\nFirst, we used the bigram analysis to develop the lexicons of video game attributes. The developed lexicons help to understand and study the attributes of video game products, which have several practical applications, including product development, product maintenance ([Lawless and Civille, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib68)), [marketing research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/marketing-research "Learn more about marketing research from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), and video game research ([Bedwell et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib9); [Marlow et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib78); [Wilson et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib106)). For instance, with the assistance of our lexicons, researchers are able to conduct replication studies to verify whether the established knowledge from other contexts ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)) are applicable in the video game context, which is a process that is increasingly valued by marketing researchers ([Easley et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib33); [Evanschitzky and Scott Armstrong, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib37)). Moreover, our lexicons can also serve as a corpus that allows video game researchers to develop a more parsimonious taxonomy of video game attributes, which remains a research gap in the video game literature ([Marlow et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib78)).\n\nSecond, our results align with the viewpoint that sellers are losing control over their brands and products with the presence of customer reviews ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). Therefore, relying exclusively on markers’ own content may not be the most effective way to drive product sales ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Nevertheless, practitioners can still increase product sales by describing in detail their products, as the informativeness in product description increases the informativeness in customer reviews, which eventually drives product sales. Moreover, markers are encouraged to incorporate more images of their products on the product page, which directly drives product sales.\n\nThird, the results indicate that informativeness and readability of customer reviews are two crucial factors that drive product sales in e-commerce platforms. Therefore, markers should attach great importance to buyer-created content. In line with the suggestions from previous researchers ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), we also recommend practitioners implement an appropriate marketing initiative that combines seller-created and buyer-created content. Specifically, marketing managers are encouraged to consider developing customer incentive programmes like Amazon Vine,[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn9) in which the informativeness and readability in the reviews that participants write should be highly valued.\n\n6. Limitations and future research\n----------------------------------\n\nDespite the implications that this research offers, some limitations are identified.\n\nFirst, the empirical model of this research specifies the inter-relationships between the key components of seller-created and buy-created content that affect product sales. However, according to the standpoint of [social cognitive theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/social-cognitive-theory "Learn more about social cognitive theory from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Bandura, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib7)), individuals’ behaviour is not only influenced by environmental factors (which are included in this research) but also is influenced by personal factors (e.g., cognition, beliefs, skills, affects). Therefore, we encourage future researchers to extend our conceptual framework by incorporating [psychometric](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychometrics "Learn more about psychometric from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") factors, such as attitude and behavioural intention. This approach helps to reveal the [reciprocal interactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/reciprocal-interaction "Learn more about reciprocal interactions from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") among the three sets of influences in the e-commerce context.\n\nSecond, we observed the mediating role of review informativeness between product description informativeness and product sales. However, as this is an [observational study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/observational-studies "Learn more about observational study from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), it is not possible to estimate the causal effect of buyer-created content on product sales. The casual inference is important in the marketing discipline because researchers are interested in certain exposures to customer behaviour ([Varian, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib101)). Future researchers are encouraged to adopt the following approaches to make causal inferences for the results of our research. On the one hand, as randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard approach ([Austin, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib5)), it is recommended to replicate our study in the experimental setting. On the other hand, researchers can also use [propensity score matching](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/propensity-score-matching "Learn more about propensity score matching from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") to analyse the observational data to mimic some characteristics of a randomised controlled trial ([Austin, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib5)).\n\nThird, we detected the double-edged role of buyer-created images. We speculate that buyer-created images can also convoy positive or negative valence. Computer vision techniques have been used to automatically classify images on social media for [marketing research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/marketing-research "Learn more about marketing research from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Argyris et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib4)). Therefore, in future research, it is recommended to use deep learning algorithms to automatically classify the images with positive or negative valence and explore their relationships with product sales when the corresponding training set in the e-commerce context is available. Moreover, in line with previous researchers ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)), we also encourage future researchers to monitor closely the development of commercial cloud computing services, like the image classification algorithm of the AWS[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn10), which may be another solution to approach the research objective.\n\nForth, we focused on products in the video games category on the [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") platform. Products from the mentioned category are experience goods, which require sampling or purchase to evaluate the product quality ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Customer reviews are essentially crucial for buyers before purchasing experience goods like video games ([Zhu and Zhang, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib115), [2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)), which makes this product category adequate to study the mediating and moderating roles of the factors derived from both seller-created and buyer-created content. Nevertheless, the [sample selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/sample-selection "Learn more about sample selection from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") is double-edged. Customer reviews are expected to influence product sales only when consumers’ reliance on customer reviews is sufficiently high, which is further influenced by product characteristics ([Zhu and Zhang, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)). Therefore, although results in this research are expected to generalise to experience goods, future researchers are suggested to verify whether the results of this research are generalisable to search goods, such as digital cameras, laser printers, and [mobile phones](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mobile-phone "Learn more about mobile phones from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"). Unlike experience goods, consumers have the ability to obtain information on product quality before purchasing search goods ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Especially, researchers are encouraged to determine whether product type (experience/search goods) serves as a moderator between the essential factors and product sales in this research, as product type has been verified as an important moderator between various factors and the helpfulness of customer review ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40); [Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98)).\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n---------------------------------\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\n\nWe acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [Project number: [PID2019-108554RB-I00](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#gs1)] and the Public University of Navarre.

Therefore, sellers must convey quality cues that are readily identifiable to such consumers. However, thanks to major technological advances and the development of social interaction systems on e-commerce platforms, individuals can now access large volumes of information (reviews, opinions, ratings) posted directly by fellow consumers, which can also provide cues by which to judge product quality, pre-purchase. Based on dual-process theory and signaling theory, the objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the heuristic or systematic cues related to electronic word-of-mouth on consumer perceived product quality, to determine how this quality affects perceived product performance risk and consumer purchase intention. A quantitative approach was taken using a structured online questionnaire. Data were collected from 835 consumers of e-commerce platforms and analyzed using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling and LISREL software. The results show that the quantity of reviews, source credibility, review usefulness, and brand experience all exert a positive and significant effect on perceived product quality, which, in turn, positively and significantly influences purchase intention. A negative and significant relationship between product performance risk and purchase intention is also found. The findings contribute to the literature by improving our understanding of those determinants of perceived product quality in e-commerce that motivate consumers to make a purchase and can help sellers improve their use of integrated social interaction tools to adequately reflect the quality of their products.    \n*   ### [Importance and performance in PLS-SEM and NCA: Introducing the combined importance-performance map analysis (cIPMA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924000195)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract This research offers a novel approach that extends the application of importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) in partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) by incorporating findings from a necessary condition analysis (NCA). The IPMA comprises assessing latent variables and their indicators\' importance and performance, while an NCA introduces an additional dimension by identifying factors that are crucial for achieving the desired outcomes. An NCA employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for an outcome, while PLS-SEM follows an additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to high performance levels. Integrating these two logics into the performance dimension is particularly valuable for prioritizing actions that could improve the target outcomes, such as customer satisfaction and employee commitment. Although the combined use of PLS-SEM and NCA is a recent suggestion, this study is the first to combine them with an IPMA (i.e., in a combined IPMA; cIPMA). A case study illustrates the combined use of PLS-SEM and an NCA to undertake a cIPMA. This innovative approach enhances researchers\' and practitioners\' decision making, enabling them to prioritize their efforts effectively.    \n*   ### [How real-time interaction and sentiment influence online sales? Understanding the role of live streaming danmaku](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924000894)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract Live streaming danmaku can reflect both real-time interaction and user sentiment, two key characteristics of live streaming e-commerce. Using a sentiment analysis of live streaming danmaku comments, our study explores the mechanism through which user-user interaction influences live streaming sales. We collect real world data including live streaming danmaku, user stay time, sales from the Douyin live streaming e-commerce platform (the Chinese version of TikTok). Quantifying user-user interaction with BERT model, we then perform a sentiment analysis using the Baidu API. The results of our analysis demonstrate that entertainment-type and information-type user interaction have a significant positive effect on flow, including user stay time, number of danmaku, number of people sending danmaku. Our study also identifies that number of danmaku and number of people sending danmaku play a partial mediating role between user interactions and live streaming sales. Furthermore, we find that user sentiment plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between several flow variables and user purchase behavior. Theoretically, our study proposes a new method to empirically analyze user behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Practically, in light of these findings, we propose several optimization strategies to enhance the interaction functions of live streaming commerce, so as to enhance user experience and stimulate purchase intention.    \n*   ### [The importance of online customer reviews characteristics on remanufactured product sales: Evidence from the mobile phone market on Amazon.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923004289)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services Citation Excerpt : \nFilieri et al. (2021) used PLS-SEM to find the usefulness of online customer reviews had beneficial impacts on customers’ satisfaction using data from TripAdvisor. The empirical results of Cai et al. (2023) showed that review readability had a direct effect on the sales of products, and review informativeness plays moderating role. Previous literature also concentrated on the connection between online customer reviews\' emotion and purchase behaviors or product sales (e.g., Guo et al., 2020).   Show abstract Remanufactured products have emerged as an important option for achieving sustainable development, which is crucial to the success of the circular economy. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate the influence of online customer reviews on remanufactured product sales, an aspect that has not been well understood in current research. In this study, we employed natural language processing methodologies, analyzing over 50,000 reviews from 2020 to 2021 on Amazon.com to explore the impacts of online customer reviews on remanufactured product sales. The findings indicate that the formal characteristics of online customer reviews, that is, review length and review valence have positive influences on remanufactured product sales. Furthermore, the content characteristics of online customer reviews, including the volume and valence of product usability, product service quality, and product cost performance, positively promote remanufactured product sales. Additionally, this study reveals three emotional characteristics of online customer reviews that significantly influence remanufactured product sales. Specifically, contentment and surprise positively affect remanufactured product sales, while anger negatively affects remanufactured product sales. The findings of this study provide useful insights for remanufactured product sellers to manage online customer reviews and develop marketing strategies.    \n*   ### [Customization at a glance: Investigating consumer experiences in mobile commerce applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923003533)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services Citation Excerpt : \nTherefore, a comparison of opinions with each other within the same social group triggers SI. The identification among members with identical predilections significantly affects users to generate social presence, which in turn inclines them toward use behavior (Cai et al., 2023; Jaewon Choi, Lee, Sajjad and Lee, 2014). CUS based on social networking groups effectively provides recommendations from members to the target users (S. Li and Karahanna, 2012).   Show abstract The study strives to examine how customization (CUS) affects customers\' acceptance of m-commerce applications (MCA) and explore conditions where CUS would strengthen consumers\' behavioral intention (BI).

Our findings manifest that CUS positively impacts BI; this effect, meanwhile, has been partially mediated by the mediators illustrated in our model. Most importantly, all our evidence points out that CUS is key to understanding a customer\'s intention to adopt MCA. Unsurprisingly, products and services will be more helpful with CUS than with homogeneity in enhancing customers\' BI to adopt MCA. Indeed, CUS\'s effect on BI is mediated by a wide range of mediated factors. Our results indicate that UTAUT2 factors influence customers\' intentions to adopt MCA. Hence, this study considers it a significant value addition to the theory and practice.    \n*   ### [Return freight strategies and selling formats in e-commerce supply chain: The perspective of consumer fairness concerns and online shopping returns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923002400)\n\n2023, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract Returns and consumer fairness concerns put a huge pressure on manufacturers who sell their products online. The optimal selling format and return freight strategy become particularly important for manufacturers in an e-commerce supply chain. Therefore, we build game models for the following scenarios under different selling formats: the seller bearing the return freight costs or the return-freight insurance premiums, consumers buying insurance for themselves, and no one buying insurance. By comparing the optimal solutions of the game models under reselling and agency formats, several conclusions are derived. In the agency format, if the return-freight insurance premium is higher than a particular threshold, then the optimal strategy of the manufacturer is to decrease the selling price to encourage consumers to purchase the insurance, otherwise, the manufacturer should purchase the insurance. As the level of consumer fairness concerns and platform commission rates increase, the manufacturer should gradually move from the agency to reselling format. In the reselling format, if the return-freight insurance premium is lower than a particular threshold, then consumers will purchase insurance and this will make the platform more profitable, and conversely, the platform should bear the return freight costs.    \n\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-85138218423&md5=8550dee2cfdbbe7d58ea332aaf687d6)\n\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bfn1)\n\nIn this article, we call the informativeness embedded in buyer-created content as review informativeness, and that from seller-created content as product description informativeness.

        "in the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, as the direct relationship mentioned is not significant. Third, the coefficient of the direct effect of review readability is negative, indicating that it is positively associated with product sales, as a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text (Korfiatis et al., 2012; Liu and Park, 2015). Although this result differs from the previous study (Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011), it is in line [...] First, our research reveals that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. This empirical finding is an important complement to the previous normative model of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context (Chen and Xie, 2008). This finding confirms the viewpoint of previous researchers: sellers are losing control over their brands and products (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010) because [...] To verify the proposed hypotheses, we assessed the path coefficients. The results are shown in Table 6 and are visualised in Fig. 8. Among the results, it is worth mentioning that the total indirect effect of product description informativeness (PDI) on product sales (LISR) is significant (0.023, p<0.001), while the direct effect of the same relationship is not significant (−0.016, p=0.162).

Two types of content coexist on modern e-commerce platforms like Amazon.com, called seller-created and buyer-created content. Extant literature suggests a range of factors that influence product sales on e-commerce platforms, including informativeness, [readability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/readability "Learn more about readability from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), multimedia richness, and extreme valence. However, interactions among the mentioned factors from both seller-created and buyer-created content remain to be empirically verified. This research embeds dual processing theory and dual coding theory as theoretical foundations in the conceptual framework, which determines the interrelationships among key drivers that affect product sales. To verify the hypotheses, we collected the data from Amazon (n = 5248) and estimated the empirical model using partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM). Among the results, it is highlighted that review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. While readability, multimedia richness, and extreme valence from buyer-created content exert both direct and moderating effects, the only factor from seller-created content that significantly affects product sales is multimedia richness. These findings confirm that, with the presence of customer reviews on product pages, sellers are losing control over the relevant information on their brands and products on the e-commerce platform: factors from buyer-created content are more directly influencing product sales. Nevertheless, sellers can still influence product sales by enhancing their content\'s informativeness and media richness.\n\n*   [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002193)\n*   [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698922002338)\n\nKeywords\n--------\n\ne-commerce\n\nSeller-created content\n\nBuyer-created content\n\nVideo games\n\nPLS-SEM\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\nE-commerce has been growing fast in recent years. Taking [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) as an example, the first-party e-commerce net scales on this platform have increased 3.2 times from 2014 to 2021 ([Statista, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib96)). During the [lockdown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/lockdown "Learn more about lockdown from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") caused by COVID-19, e-commerce accelerated its growth as new and existing customers chose to purchase products via available channels ([Barnes, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib8)). Therefore, it is not surprising to see that the net sales on [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) increased dramatically (1.4 times) in 2020 compared with 2019 ([Statista, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib96)). More importantly, given the early lessons from China ([Stewart, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib97)), post-COVID-19 consumers may be more willing to accept e-commerce as a purchase channel ([Barnes, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib8)).\n\nThe rapid development of e-commerce greatly impacts sellers’ marketing strategies. In the old years, customers were predominantly passive receivers of marketing and media information, and companies could avoid negative information because they almost completely controlled the brand-sharping messages ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). However, nowadays, companies have lost absolute control over the product information: consumers are using several portals to share comments and reviews about products or services, such as the comment area of online retailers and third-party channels ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). These new sources of information are essential for consumers when purchasing [experience goods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/experience-goods "Learn more about experience goods from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") like video games ([Zhu and Zhang, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib115), [2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)) because, for experience goods, it is relatively difficult and costly to obtain information on [product quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-quality "Learn more about product quality from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") before interacting with the product ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)).\n\nConsumers now find on e-commerce platforms two types of content, which are seller-created and buyer-created content ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20); [Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). In the social media context, these two types of content are also called marketer-generated and user-generated content ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Researchers have conducted a series of studies about their relationships to consumer behaviour and product sales regarding seller-created and buyer-created content.\n\nOn the side of buyer-created content, researchers have found that many determinants are associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. Several meta-analyses have been conducted to summarise the primary metrics of consumer reviews that affect product sales ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). Recent evidence suggests that review informativeness[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn1) is positively related to review helpfulness ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), which affects product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Informativeness, also called information richness, refers to the amount of information embedded in seller-created and buyer-created contents ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Moreover, readability ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), multimedia richness ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)), and valence ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)) of buyer-created content are positively associated with product sales. Additionally, researchers found that review valence moderated the relationship between review informativeness and [product evaluations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-evaluation "Learn more about product evaluations from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)).\n\nOn the side of seller-created content, researchers have found that information presentation of products is related to [mood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/mood "Learn more about mood from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), perceived risk, and purchase intention ([Park et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib87)). Meanwhile, vividness and interactivity are two critical components of information presentation in customers’ purchase patterns ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib61)). Besides, image-text presentation outperforms text-only presentation in terms of shorter information searching time on product listing pages ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)). Besides, media richness positively affects purchase intention through satisfaction with seller-created content ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)). Moreover, researchers found that high-quality product descriptions affected purchase intention through product involvement ([Mou et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib80)).\n\nSeller-created content and buyer-created content also jointly affect consumers’ trust ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27)), purchase intention ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)), purchase decision ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), and product sales ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Additionally, the psychological and informational distances between the two types of information affect review helpfulness ([Alzate et al., 2021a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib2)).\n\nDespite the rich theoretical and empirical evidence regarding the impacts of seller-created and buyer-created content on product sales on e-commerce platforms, several research gaps are noted. First, although the information from seller-created and buyer-created content could be complementary or substitutionary ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), the empirical evidence is scant. Second, although researchers speculated that more readable content enhanced the relationship between informativeness and product sales ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), the moderating role of readability is not empirically verified. Third, existing evidence suggests that multimedia richness affects purchase intention through the perception of consumer reviews ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)). Nevertheless, the relationship between multimedia richness and product sales remains explored. Forth, although researchers have found the moderating role of review valence between informativeness and product evaluations ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)), researchers still do not know whether the same moderating role exists between informativeness and product sales.\n\nTherefore, this research aims to verify:\n*   (1)whether the impacts of the informativeness in seller-created and buyer-created content (product description informativeness/review informativeness) on product sales are complementary or substitutionary. \n*   (2)the moderating role of the readability of seller-created and buyer-created content (product description readability/review readability) between the corresponding informativeness (product description informativeness/review informativeness) and product sales. \n*   (3)the moderating role of the multimedia richness in seller-created and buyer-created content (product multimedia richness/review multimedia richness) between the corresponding informativeness (product description informativeness/review informativeness) and product sales. \n*   (4)the moderating role of valence in buyer-created content (review valence) between the informativeness (review informativeness) in buyer-created content and product sales. \n\nTo achieve the mentioned goals, we created a conceptual framework combining the dual processing theory ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)) and the dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)), through which the hypotheses were proposed. To test the hypotheses in our conceptual framework, we collected data of video game products from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) using a third-party API service: the Rainforest API. Then, we operationalised the constructs and measured the variables, including creating the lexicons of video game attributes. Finally, we estimated the empirical model using partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM).\n\nThis research makes several contributions to the e-commerce literature as well as to practitioners and researchers in this field. On the theoretical side, our empirical findings suggest that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales, which complements the previous [normative model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/normative-model "Learn more about normative model from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). On the practical side, based on the empirical results, we provide concrete guidance for marketers to enhance their strategies on e-commerce platforms. Moreover, as an additional product of the research process, we developed the lexicons of video game attributes, which can help practitioners and researchers to understand and study the attributes of video game products.\n\n2. Theoretical background and hypothesis\n----------------------------------------\n\n### 2.1. Dual processing theory, dual coding theory, and conceptual framework\n\nIn [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") literature, scholars have used dual processing theory ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)) and dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)) to address a series of research issues. On the one hand, [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") researchers use dual processing theory to explore review helpfulness ([Bigne et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib15)), customers’ evaluation and recall ([Book et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib16)), and product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). On the other hand, dual coding theory is used to explore review helpfulness ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), review enjoyment ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), and examine product listing page design ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)). In the study, we used the mentioned two theories to construct our conceptual framework.\n\nThe dual processing theory in the [social psychology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/social-psychology "Learn more about social psychology from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") literature suggests two distinct processes in [human cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/human-cognition "Learn more about human cognition from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") that influence peoples’ attitudes: System 1 process and System 2 process ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). While System 1 is characterised as unconscious and perceptual, System 2 is conscious and analytic ([Evans, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib36)). Different authors have proposed distinct names for the two processes ([Evans, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib36)), and in line with some researchers ([Epstein and Pacini, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib34)), we call System 1 as experiential process and System 2 as rational process in this study. Marketing researchers have used dual processing theory to explain how informativeness and valence of consumer reviews affect product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)): while informativeness generates the rational process, valence generates the experiential process.\n\nSince consumers usually [face](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/face "Learn more about face from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") incomplete information when purchasing a product ([Kivetz and Simonson, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib66)), they rely on both seller-created and buyer-created content to reduce uncertainties ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). In this research, we classified the widespread informativeness on e-commerce platforms into two categories: product description informativeness from seller-created content and review informativeness from buyer-created content. While product description informativeness includes product-related information (e.g., introduction and specifications of the product), review informativeness contains customers’ experience of the product and e-commerce platform (e.g., product features and shopping experience) ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)).\n\nMoreover, consumers\' purchasing decision on e-commerce platforms is affected by the valence of the information received ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). Valence is the favourability, sentiment, and polarity in a piece of information, which can be either positive, negative, or neutral ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). On the one hand, consumers’ attitude towards a product is formed, reinforced, or altered from the exposure to positive or negative reviews from other consumers ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). On the other hand, although we acknowledge that there is a stream of research suggesting the positive effects of negative information ([Crowley and Hoyer, 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib29)), we assume that seller-created content always has positive valence on e-commerce platforms. In general, negative [marketing communication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/marketing-communications "Learn more about marketing communication from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") is used to denigrate a product in an attempt to either discourage some attitude/behaviour or to establish some alternative attitude/behaviour ([Weinberger et al., 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib104)). Therefore, it is not an optimal strategy for retailers to place negative information about the product on the page where consumers place the order.\n\nDual processing theory explains the relationship between text information and product sales on e-commerce platforms. However, in many cases, there is not only text information but also multimedia information on the product page, such as images created by both sellers and buyers. To complete the conceptual framework, we embedded the dual coding theory. According to dual coding theory ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)), there are two ways that an individual could expand on learned material, which are verbal associations and visual imagery. Two cognitive systems are involved in processing textual and visual information. While the verbal system involves sequential processing following a certain direction, the non-verbal system involves parallel or synchronous processing, in which the available information is processed up to some limit. On the one hand, as both verbal and non-verbal systems can be activated without the other, they can be functionally independent ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). On the other hand, as one system can activate another, they also can be functionally interconnected ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). [Information system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/information-system "Learn more about Information system from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") researchers have applied the dual coding theory to explore the influence of product listing page design and sales ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58)).\n\nConsumers make purchasing decisions relying on a combination of information stored in the memory and information that is available from current external cues ([Biehal and Chakravarti, 1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib14), [1983](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib13)). Moreover, the information may vary in media richness ([Maity and Dass, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib77)). Compared with text information, multimedia, including images and videos, present more realistic visual cues and dynamic movements for conveying product information, which is expected to have a powerful impact on consumers’ perception ([Xu et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib108)).\n\n[Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig1) demonstrates the theoretical foundations, dual processing theory and dual coding theory, and the corresponding theoretical components: product description/review informativeness, product description/review [readability](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/readability "Learn more about readability from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), product/review multimedia richness, and review valence. [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig1) also shows the sources that the theoretical components come from (Seller-created/Buyer-created content).\n\n![Image 11: Fig. 1](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr1.jpg)\n1.

Direct and mediating effects\n\nProduct information positively affects purchase intention through perceived quality and perceived value ([Chang and Wildt, 1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib19)). Dual processing theory suggests that a deliberate and conscious [cognitive process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-process "Learn more about cognitive process from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") also influences peoples\' attitude formation ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). Cognitive content significantly impacts new product sales ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). Additionally, previous empirical evidence suggests that the dimensions of informativeness, including information length ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Pan and Zhang, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib86); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)) and number of attributes ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98), [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), are positively associated with helpfulness, which is a critical component in consumers’ decision process when purchasing products ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Lee and Choeh, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib69); [Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)). Thus, we infer that informativeness, whether from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H1a**\n\nProduct description informativeness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H1b**\n\nReview informativeness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nProduct description informativeness and review informativeness is correlated. Previously, researchers found that subjective norms were positively related to customers’ intention to write [online reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/online-reviews "Learn more about online reviews from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Dixit et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib32)). Subjective norms refer to the belief that an important person or group will approve and support a particular behaviour ([Ham et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib52)). Moreover, subjective norms are determined by the social pressure that individuals perceive when conducting certain behaviour ([Ham et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib52)). Therefore, as subjective norms are related to perceived social pressure, marketers\' initiatives not only increase the number of customer reviews but also increase the social sense of responsibility in review writing ([Dixit et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib32)). Thus, we infer that when seller-created content is more informative, customers perceive a social pressure that sharps their subjective norms when writing their reviews. The result of this behavioural process will be a more comprehensive and informative review. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formed:\n**H2**\n\nProduct description informativeness is positively associated with review informativeness on e-commerce platforms.\n\nWhile seller-created content is product-oriented, consumer-generated information is consumer-oriented ([Bickart and Schindler, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib12)). Therefore, buyer-created content is more relevant to consumers than marketer-generated information ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). Previous empirical evidence suggests that buyer-created content exhibits a stronger impact than seller-created content on consumer purchase behaviour ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Thus, we infer that, as the seller-created and buyer-created content coexist on e-commerce platforms, the effect of product description informativeness can be transmitted with the help of review informativeness. In other words, review informativeness partially or completely absorb the effect of product description informativeness on product sales. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formed:\n**H3**\n\nReview informativeness mediates the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nCustomer reviews should be precise and easy to understand without possible conflicts ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). In the e-commerce context, readability evaluates how easy it is to read and comprehend a piece of text information about the product ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67)). The readability of the text information reflects its author\'s social status, [education level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/education-level "Learn more about education level from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), and social hierarchy ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). The readability of a piece of information is positively associated with helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)). Meanwhile, the helpfulness of information influences product sales on e-commerce platforms ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Thus, we infer that the readability of the text content, no matter seller-created or buyer-created, is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H4a**\n\nProduct description readability is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H4b**\n\nReview readability is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nOn e-commerce platforms, multimedia, including seller-created and buyer-created images and videos, coexist with text content to convey important product information to consumers. Multimedia has a significant effect on individuals\' intention to visit websites ([Lu et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib75)), which eventually leads to purchase. Moreover, empirical results reveal that the number of images, such as foods and beverages, is positively related to review helpfulness ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), which further enhances product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Therefore, we infer that multimedia, from either seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H5a**\n\nProduct multimedia richness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H5b**\n\nReview multimedia richness is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nApart from the conscious cognitive process, dual processing theory also suggests that unconscious and emotional process also influences peoples\' attitude formation ([Chaiken and Trope, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib18)). Valence is an indicator of a product\'s reputation and expected [product quality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/product-quality "Learn more about product quality from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65); [Liu, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib73)). Positive reviews enhance consumers\' perceived quality and attitude towards the product, while negative reviews usually have an unfavourable impact on the attitude towards the product ([Liu, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib73)). Regarding the types of valence, on the one hand, researchers found that platform-related valence affected the trust in the seller ([Ba and Pavlou, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib6)). On the other hand, researchers found that product-related consumer reviews\' valence was significantly associated with mobile game sales ([Jang et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib60)). Additionally, existing empirical evidence from meta-analysis studies suggests that, in general, positive valence is positively associated with product sales, and negative valence is negatively associated with product sales ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)). The influence of review valence is even more strong when the valence is extreme ([Hong et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib57)). Extreme valence refers to the evaluation that contains either extremely positive or extremely negative sentiment ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40)). Empirical evidence reveals that extreme rating leads to more helpfulness ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40)), which leads to higher product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Therefore, we infer that the proposition of extreme review valence is associated with product sales. Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H6a**\n\nProportion of extreme negative valence in customer reviews is negatively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H6b**\n\nProportion of extreme positive valence in customer reviews is positively associated with product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n#### 2.2.2. Moderating effects\n\nThe readability of text content could influence its value ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)). Information is easier to be processed and evaluated when it contains explicit statements ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)). Customers are “_cognitive misers_”, who take the easiest path to a solution, such as a purchasing decision, especially when they are goal-oriented ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)). The cognitive fit occurs when the information in the text matches customers’ own information-processing strategy ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67)). Cognitive fit suggests that, for the most effective and efficient problem solving to occur, the problem representation and any aids employed should support the strategies required to perform that task ([Vessey and Galletta, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib102)). Therefore, we consider that higher readability of the text information will trigger the cognitive fit of customers. The cognitive fit further leads to effective and efficient problem solving, which in the e-commerce setting is the purchasing decision. Thus, we infer that the readability of the text information, whether from seller-created or buyer-created content, empowers the connection between informativeness and product sales on e-commerce platforms. The following hypotheses are formed:\n**H7a**\n\nProduct description readability strengthens the effect of product description informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H7b**\n\nReview Readability strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nA vivid product presentation offers consumers more informational cues about a product and stimulates more sensory channels than a pallid product presentation ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib61)). Generally, multimedia is used on e-commerce platforms to create vividness of product presentation ([Jiang and Benbasat, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib62)). Multimedia conveys non-verbal information using a richer set of symbol systems and, therefore, better preserves the original meanings, which reduces the chances of misinterpretation ([Lim et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib71)). According to dual coding theory, imagery stimuli are more likely to be coded visually and verbally, and text information is less likely to be coded visually ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). Thus, the dual coding process makes images easier to remember, generating the “Picture superiority effect”: visual information is more likely to be remembered than words ([Paivio, 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib85)). Moreover, “_the greater number of memory codes for images acts as multiple retrieval routes to those images, and therefore enhances information retention and recall_ ([Hong et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib58), p. 484, p. 484)”. Thus, we infer that the multimedia content, no matter seller-created or buyer-created, empower the connection between text information and product sales on e-commerce platforms. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H8a**\n\nProduct multimedia richness strengthens the effect of product description informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H8b**\n\nReview multimedia richness strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\nApart from the direct effects of review informativeness and review valence on product sales, they may also interact. According to the [attribution theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/attribution-theory "Learn more about attribution theory from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), consumers may attribute emotions internally or externally ([Folkes, 1988](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib42)). While internal emotion refers to the personal disposition of reviews, external emotion refers to the reviewed product ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Researchers found that people tended to attribute other peoples\' negative behaviour internally and other peoples\' positive behaviour externally ([Zuckerman, 1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib116)). Therefore, whether consumers attribute reviewers’ emotions internally or externally depends on the review valence ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Empirical evidence revealed that negative valence in a single review tended to decrease its informativeness, making the evaluation less negative ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)). Following this analogy, we propose that positive valence in a review tends to increase its informativeness, which makes the evaluation more positive. Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\n**H9a**\n\nExtreme negative review valence weakens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n**H9b**\n\nExtreme positive review valence strengthens the effect of review informativeness on product sales on e-commerce platforms.\n\n### 2.3. Control variables\n\nApart from the potential relationships between the mentioned essential factors and product sales, previous empirical evidence suggests a series of other variables affecting product sales. In line with the previous empirical evidence, we included the following control variables in the empirical model: price ([Chevalier and Goolsbee, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib25); [Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)), product average rating ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Li et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib70)), product rating volume ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)), top review[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn2) rating variance ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [Wang et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib103)), summed amount of helpfulness in top reviews ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)), and top review volume ([Floyd et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib41); [Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91); [You et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib111)).\n\n3. Methodology\n--------------\n\n### 3.1. Data source\n\nWe collected data from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) (United States). Amazon data, including product descriptions (Seller-created content) and consumer reviews (Buyer-created content), were obtained using a third-party API: Rainforest API.[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn3) Amazon data was used because data from this e-commerce platform had been widely used in previous studies to explore the relationships between determinants and product sales ([Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Dhar and Chang, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib31); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Additionally, we focused on products in the video games category because video games are [experience goods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/experience-goods "Learn more about experience goods from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), which are relatively difficult and costly for customers to obtain information on their quality before interacting with them ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Therefore, reviews from other customers are especially important for buyers when purchasing experience goods ([Zhang et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib112)). Moreover, we selected the samples from the American site of Amazon because the United States was the largest video game market by global revenues, with $36.9 billion in 2009 ([Newzoo, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib82)). Driven by the growth in console game revenues, it overtook China for the #1 position ([Newzoo, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib82)).\n\nLike many other e-commerce platforms, Amazon samples some reviews that receive the highest helpfulness votes in the top review section of the product page. The mentioned approach saves consumers’ time in accessing quality reviews ([Saumya et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib93)). It is worth mentioning that, in this research, all the consumer reviews come from the top review section of the product page instead of including all reviews of a video game title. We only included top reviews of a video game title because it is difficult for consumers to go through all the reviews to make purchase decisions ([Singh et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib94)). According to [Brightlocal (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib17), 80% of consumers read less than ten reviews before trusting a product or service. Moreover, when a piece of [eWOM](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/electronic-word-of-mouth "Learn more about eWOM from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") information is immediately visible and displayed in a structured way, it has a greater impact ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)).\n\n### 3.2. Data collection and data screening\n\nWe collected the data on July 2, 2021. On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), every product has a unique identifier called the ASIN code. We searched all the physical video game software (memory card or disc) in the following categories on Amazon: “PlayStation 4″, “PlayStation 5″, “Xbox One”, “Xbox Series X & S″, and “Nintendo Switch”. In this step, 9639 observations were found and included in the dataset. Due to network issues, sometimes the API returned duplicated observations with the same ASIN code. After screening out the duplicated observations, there were 9565 observations in the dataset. Moreover, due to the maintenance and other factors related to sellers, some product pages on Amazon did not contain the essential information, including ranking, product description, and price. Therefore, the mentioned observations needed to be further screened out, and 7717 observations remained in the dataset.\n\nIn this research, we only focused on the products with description in English, as it is the most commonly used language in the United States. Therefore, we screened out the observations in which the product description was written in non-English languages. To achieve this object, we used the Amazon Comprehend service,[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn4) a natural-language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover information in unstructured data. Commercial solutions like Amazon Web Services (AWS) require fewer or no training examples and less technical expertise to implement and calibrate the machine learning methods ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)). Specifically, in this case, we used the function of Language Detection, which automatically identifies text written in over 100 languages and returns the dominant language in the text with a confidence score. We first screened out the observations with confidence scores lower than 0.9 (7539 observations remained) and removed the observations in which the description was not written in English (7506 observations remained).\n\nThen, we removed the outliers in the dataset. The outliers should be removed from the dataset because the extreme values may have an unfavourable influence on the estimated results, even when using a robust method like partial [least squares](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/least-square "Learn more about least squares from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages")[structural equation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/structural-equation-modeling "Learn more about structural equation modelling from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") (PLS-SEM) ([Ghasemy et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib44); [Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). To remove the outliers, we conducted two operations. First, we removed the observations with the extraordinary price: either too low (less than $10) or too high (more than $100) because the products outside the normal price range suggest that they are not the regular retailing games in the market.[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn5) At this step, 6771 observations remained in the dataset. Second, we removed the observations without customer reviews (5271 observations remained) and applied a machine learning approach, isolation forest ([Liu et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib72)), to detect the multivariate outliers in the dataset. We set the sub-sampling size as 256 and the number of trees as 100, as these are the recommended parameters based on the previous empirical evidence ([Liu et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib72)). Then, we fed the algorithm on all the items that measure the variables and factors mentioned, which will be introduced in the following section. We screened out the observations with anomaly scores[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn6) larger than 0.65. Finally, 5248 observations remained in the dataset. [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl1) shows the whole data screening procedure.\n\nTable 1. Screening procedure.\n\n| Step | Operation | n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Original number of observations. | 9639 |\n| 2 | Remove the observations with duplicated ASIN code. | 9565 |\n| 3 | Remove the observations that: 1. Do not have the ranking information. 2. Do not have any product description. 3. Do not have the price. | 7717 |\n| 4 | Remove the observations with low language confidence score (<0.9). | 7539 |\n| 5 | Remove the observations in which the product description is not written in English. | 7506 |\n| 6 | Remove the observations with extraordinary price (less than $10 or higher than $100). | 6771 |\n| 7 | Remove the observations without customer reviews. | 5271 |\n| 8 | Remove the outliers. | 5248 |\n\n### 3.3. Operationalisation, measurement, and structural model\n\nRegarding the operationalisation of the theoretical components in our conceptual framework, in line with previous researchers ([Bergkvist and Rossiter, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib11)), we classified the components into two types: concrete singular components and abstract collective components. While the concrete singular component refers to the component with only one object to be rated, the abstract collective component is a set of concrete singular components that collectively form a higher-level theoretical category ([John R, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib63)). Thus, according to this classification, informativeness and valence belong to the abstract collective components, while readability, multimedia richness, product sales, and other control variables in our conceptual framework, are the concrete singular components.\n\nRegarding the operationalisation of the informativeness, there are different approaches in the literature, including information length ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Filieri et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib39); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Pan and Zhang, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib86); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Wu, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib107)) and the number of attributes ([Nikolay et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib83); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)). However, according to the definition of informativeness ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), it is an abstract concept in nature, which implies that it is not directly observable, and we can only obtain indirect evidence of its relationship with other concepts through its operationalisation ([Podsakoff et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib89)). The ubiquitous one indicator approach of operationalising informativeness as a manifest variable in the literature may be conceptually deficient, as this approach fails to articulate all the essential properties of the concept. Therefore, in this research, we operationalised the concept of informativeness as a reflective latent factor, which captures the two dimensions in the content domain of the concept in the current literature.\n\nRegarding the measurement of the two indicators of informativeness, on the one hand, the information length was measured by the total number of words in a product description or consumer review. On the other hand, the number of attributes was measured by our self-developed lexicons (See [Appendix I](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1) for the developing process and [Appendix II](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1) for the developed lexicons). As for the specific data source of the two types of informativeness, we measured product description informativeness using the pooled text content from the purchase section (See [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig3)), the “From the manufacturer” section (See [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig4)), and the “Product description” section (See [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig5)). Similarly, we measured review informativeness using the pooled text content from the consumer review section (See [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig6)).\n\n![Image 13: Fig. 3](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr3.jpg)\n1.

Example of the content displayed in the consumer review section.\n\nTo measure the readability, we used a readability equation, the automated readability index (ARI) ([Smith and Senter, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib95)). The ARI was originally developed to measure the readability of written materials in the American [Air Force](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/air-force "Learn more about Air Force from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), which is positively associated with the educational grade level ([Smith and Senter, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib95)). We selected ARI to measure readability in this study because it was one of the most commonly used equations in academic research ([Zhou et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib113)). In the e-commerce context, a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)). The rationale behind this logic is that when a text can be easily comprehended by readers with fewer years of formal education, it implies that the text contains less complicated vocabulary, which makes it more readable ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)).\n\nAs for the operationalisation of review valence, researchers have quantified this concept in various ways ([Rosario et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib91)). Some researchers used relative measures to quantify the valence, such as the ratio of one-star and the ratio of five-star rating ([Chen et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib22); [Chevalier and Mayzlin, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib26)), text sentiment ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), and hierarchical approach ([Eslami and Ghasemaghaei, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib35)). Due to the abstract definition and non-observable nature of valence, in line with the previous research ([Eslami and Ghasemaghaei, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib35)), we also operationalised extreme valence as a reflective latent factor. We used the ratio of five-star rating and the ratio of positive text sentiment to measure extreme positive valence, while we used the ratio of one-star rating and the ratio of negative text sentiment to measure extreme negative valence. To acquire the sentiment labels for the text, we used the Amazon Comprehend service.[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn7) Previous empirical results suggest that, compared with lexicon-based approaches (LIWC, in particular), machine learning methods significantly improve prediction accuracy ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)).\n\nRegarding multimedia richness, we measured this variable using the number of images from the seller-created and buyer-created content. Specifically, we measured product multimedia richness using the pooled multimedia content from the purchase section (See [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig3)), the “From the manufacturer” section (See [Fig. 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig4)), and the “Product description” section (See [Fig. 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig5)). Similarly, we measured review multimedia richness using the pooled multimedia content from the consumer review section (See [Fig. 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig6)).\n\nTo measure product sales, we used the logarithmic inverse sales ranking of [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) as a proxy of actual product sales. The rationale behind this approach is that the log curves between sales ranking and actual product sales are approximately linear ([Chevalier and Goolsbee, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib25)). Besides, this approach is also in line with previous empirical studies, in which product sales on e-commerce platforms is the [dependent variable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/dependent-variable "Learn more about dependent variable from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Alzate et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib3); [Chen et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib21); [Chong et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib28); [Cui et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib30); [Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)).\n\nIn terms of the measurement of the control variables, we used the corresponding numerical data from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/).\n\n[Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl2) summarises the operationalisation, measurement, abbreviation, and description of the variables in the empirical model.\n\nTable 2. Operationalisation and measurement of the variables.\n\n| Concept | Operationalisation and measurement | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Seller-created content | Product description informativeness (PDI) | ← | Information length (PDI1) | Total number of words in the seller-created text content. |\n| Number of attributes (PDI2) | Matching the seller-created text with the custom lexicons of video game attributes. |\n| Product description readability (PDR) | ← | Readability | Value of automated readability index (ARI) of the seller-created text content. |\n| Product multimedia richness (PMR) | ← | Number of images | Total number of images shown in the seller-created section. |\n| Buyer-created content | Review informativeness (RI) | ← | Information length (RI1) | Total number of words in the buyer-created text content. |\n| Number of attributes (RI2) | Matching the buyer-created text content with the custom lexicons of video game attributes. |\n| Review Readability (RR) | ← | Readability | Value of automated readability index (ARI) of the buyer-created text content. |\n| Review multimedia richness (RMR) | ← | Number of images | Total number of images shown in the consumer review section. |\n| Extreme negative review valence (ENRV) | ← | Ratio of one-star rating (ENRV1) | Ratio of one-star rating in the top review section. |\n| Ratio of negative sentiment (ENRV2) | Ratio of negative sentiment, returned by the Amazon Comprehend, in the top review section. |\n| Extreme positive review valence (EPRV) | ← | Ratio of five-star rating (EPRV1) | Ratio of five-star rating in the top review section. |\n| Ratio of positive sentiment (EPRV2) | Ratio of positive sentiment, returned by the Amazon Comprehend, in the top review section. |\n| Control variables | Price (PRI) | Video game price in US dollars. |\n| Product average rating (PAR) | Average rating of customer reviews in the product page. |\n| Product rating volume (PRV) | Total volume of customer reviews in the product page. |\n| Top review rating variance (TRRV) | Variance of customer review ratings in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Summed amount of helpfulness in top reviews (SAHTR) | Total volume of helpfulness in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Top reviews volume (TRV) | Total volume of customer reviews in the “Top reviews” section. |\n| Dependent variable | Logarithmic inverse sales ranking (LISR) | A proxy variable of actual product sales using logarithmic inverse product ranking in the video game category. |\n\nThe empirical model is visualised in [Fig. 7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig7). This figure demonstrates the measurement model of the variables and the structural model that specifies the hypothesised relationships between the variables and product sales.\n\n![Image 17: Fig. 7](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr7.jpg)\n1.

Visualisation of the measurement and structural models.\n\n### 3.4. Estimation method and software environment\n\nIn this research, we used PLS-SEM to estimate the empirical models that we proposed. PLS-SEM has become a quasi-standard in marketing and management research ([Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50)). PLS-SEM is suggested to be used when (1) the objective is to extend the existing theories; (2) the structural model is complex; (3) the research is based on secondary/archival data; (4) distribution issues are a concern. ([Ghasemy et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib44); [Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50), [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib51); [Sarstedt et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib92)). As the research purpose and the data characteristics of our study meet the mentioned points, PLS-SEM was used.\n\nIn terms of the software environment, we implemented the API application to obtain Amazon data from Rainforest API using Python in Spyder. Moreover, we called the requests from Amazon Comprehend and conducted the early data analysis using R in RStudio. We used the package _aws.comprehend_ to call the Amazon Comprehend API. Furthermore, we used SmartPLS to estimate the empirical model.\n\n### 3.5.

Therefore, it is important to assess the measurement model before moving to the evaluation of the structural model ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Martínez-López et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib79)).\n\nPLS-SEM model assessment initially focuses on the measurement models, including the examination of internal consistency, [convergent validity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/convergent-validity "Learn more about convergent validity from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), and [discriminant validity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/discriminant-validity "Learn more about discriminant validity from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl4) summarises the results for the measurement model of the latent variables. According to the results, all the values of composite reliability and Cronbach\'s alpha are higher than 0.7, indicating desirable internal consistency ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). Moreover, the values of outer-loadings are higher than 0.7, while the values of average variance extracted (AVE) are higher than 0.5, indicating desirable convergent validity ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). Regarding the discriminant validity, we used both the Fornell-Larcker criterion ([Fornell and Larcker, 1981](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib43)) and the Heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) ([Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)). While the Fornell-Larcker criterion is widely used in the literature to assess discriminant validity ([Hair et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib47)), HTMT is a more sensitive and reliable approach ([Ab Hamid et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib1); [Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)). [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl5) shows the correlation matrix with AVE. On the one hand, all the values of AVE are greater than the squared correlation estimates of the corresponding variables, which provides evidence for good discriminant validity according to the Fornell-Larcker criterion. On the other hand, to implement the HTMT approach, we first checked the HTMT values (See details in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1)). All the values are below the conservative threshold of 0.85 ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Henseler et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib56)), providing the initial evidence for good discriminant validity based on HTMT. Additionally, we conducted a bootstrapping procedure, which will be explained in the following paragraph, to conduct the formal statistical discriminant tests based on HTMT. According to the results (See details in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1)), none of the confidence interval includes the value 1, providing the further evidence for good discriminant validity.\n\nTable 4.

Therefore, the corresponding cells are presented with “N/A".\n\nAfter ensuring the reliability and validity of the construct measures, we moved to assess the structural model, which includes the examination of collinearity, size and significance of path coefficients, coefficient of determination (R 2), f 2 effect sizes, predictive relevance (Q 2), and global model fit ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)). The mentioned results were returned from the bootstrapping procedure. We conducted the bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) bootstrapping procedure (two-tailed testing and a significance level of 0.05) with the number of subsamples as 10000, which is in line with the suggestion in the literature: the number of subsamples should be higher than the number of observations (5248 in this case) ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)).\n\nRegarding the collinearity assessment, we checked the values of the variance [inflation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inflation "Learn more about inflation from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") factor (VIF) of the predictors. According to the results shown in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig8), all values of VIF are below the threshold of 5, which does not indicate the multicollinearity problem in the PLS-SEM context ([Hair et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib50)).\n\n![Image 18: Fig. 8](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S096969892200234X-gr8.jpg)\n1.

Results of the estimation of [VIF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/inflation "Learn more about VIF from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), R 2, loading, and path.\n\nTo verify the proposed hypotheses, we assessed the path coefficients. The results are shown in [Table 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#tbl6) and are visualised in [Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fig8). Among the results, it is worth mentioning that the total indirect effect of product description informativeness (PDI) on product sales (LISR) is significant (0.023, p<0.001), while the direct effect of the same relationship is not significant (−0.016, p=0.162). These results suggest that a full mediated effect ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49); [Nitzl et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib84)): review informativeness (RI) fully mediates the relationship between product description informativeness (PDI) and product sales (LISR). Thus, [H3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H3) is supported. Additionally, the direct effect (−0.154, p<0.001) as well as moderating effect (−0.139, p<0.001) of review readability (RR) are negatively significant. In line with the previous studies ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)), these results suggest that when the text of customer reviews requires fewer years of formal education to be understood, the reviews are associated with more product sales and also enhances the relationship between review informativeness (RI) and product sales (LISR). Hence, [H4b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H4b) and [H7b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H7b) are supported. Moreover, although the coefficients of [H6a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H6a) and [H8b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#enun_H8b) are significant, the signs are opposite to the hypothesised relationships.

Moreover, the values of f 2, which assesses the exogenous variables\' contribution to the endogenous variables’ R 2 value, are shown in [Appendix III](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#appsec1).\n\nTo calculate the Q 2, in line with the literature ([Hair et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib49)), we conducted the blindfolding procedure with the omission distance of 7. According to the results, the Q 2 value of product sales (LISR) equals 0.407, indicating a medium-high predictive relevance for the endogenous variables in the structural model ([Hair et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib48), [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib51)).\n\nIn terms of the global model fit, the standardised root mean residual (SRMR) is 0.096.[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn8)\n\n4. Discussion\n-------------\n\nIn this research, we used dual processing theory and dual coding theory as theoretical foundations to establish our conceptual framework, which helped determine the interrelationships among the key factors driving product sales on e-commerce platforms. To verify the hypotheses, we collected the data (n=5248) from [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) and estimated the empirical model using PLS-SEM. In the following paragraphs, we discuss the highlighted results of this research.\n\nIn terms of the relationship between informativeness and product sales, we found that with the presence of customer reviews on product pages, review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. In other words, the influence of product description informativeness on product sales should completely pass-through review informativeness. Therefore, in contrast to earlier findings ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)), the relationship between seller-created and buyer-created information is not simply complementary or substitutionary. Our finding suggests that review informativeness not only positively affects product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)) but also is positively influenced by product description informativeness.\n\nAs for the relationship between readability and product sales, several insightful results are found. First, the relationship between product description readability and product sales is insignificant. We infer that, quite possibly, like product description informativeness, the influence of product description readability on product sales is absorbed by customer reviews. Further work is required to explore the mentioned relationship. Second, the moderating role of product description readability in the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, as the direct relationship mentioned is not significant. Third, the coefficient of the direct effect of review readability is negative, indicating that it is positively associated with product sales, as a lower score of ARI indicates a more readable text ([Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74)). Although this result differs from the previous study ([Ghose and Ipeirotis, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib45)), it is in line with the results from other studies, which indicate that more readable texts generate a positive marketing outcome: they are positively associated with helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Reinartz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib90)). This discrepancy may be due to the explosive growth of customer review volume in e-commerce platforms in recent years leads to information overload, which forces customers to select reviews to read ([Alzate et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib3)). In this case, more readable reviews enjoy more helpfulness ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38); [Korfiatis et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib67); [Liu and Park, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib74); [Reinartz, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib90)), which consequently leads to more product sales ([Kaushik et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib64)). Forth, the coefficient of the moderating effect of review readability is also negative. This result reveals another pathway by which review readability affects product sales: it enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales. Therefore, customers, as cognitive misers, employ not only readable reviews to assist their purchase ([Mackiewicz and Yeats, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib76)) but also find readable reviews with high informativeness valuable ([Fang et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib38)), which finally drives purchase behaviour.\n\nMultimedia richness, either from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. This finding is in line with the previous findings ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)), which indices that multimedia richness from customer reviews is positively associated with positive marketing outcomes, including review enjoyment and usefulness. Additionally, our results indicate that influences from the seller side do not fade completely: the seller-created multimedia content is still positively influencing product sales with the presence of customer reviews on product pages. Nevertheless, as the relationship between product description informativeness and product sales is not significant, the moderating role of product multimedia richness is not found. Surprisingly, review multimedia reduces the influence of review informativeness on product sales. We speculate that, like review texts, images created by buyers also convey positive (e.g., the impressive graphic performance of a game) and negative valence (e.g., a broken package of a game). If images convey negative valence, they cloud eventually decrease the positive effect of review informativeness on product sales. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to further study the double-edged role of multimedia in customer reviews in future e-commerce studies.\n\nRegarding the valence of customer reviews, it is unanticipated that while the ratio of extreme positive review valence is not significantly associated with product sales, the ratio of extreme negative review valence is positively associated with product sales. A possible explanation for this is the defensive behavioural process ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)). Researchers found that customers with high self-brand connections consider negative brand information as a threat to their positive self-view ([Cheng et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib24)), and defensive purchase is a response: they counter-argued/derogated the message source and re-affirmed their own positive attitude ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)). Researchers have found a positive relationship between negative customer reviews and product sales in several product categories, including clothing, smartphones, hotel stay ([Wilson et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib105)), and books ([Berger et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib10)). As the mentioned positive relationship also exists in the video game context, it is possible that high self-brand connections ubiquitously exist in the population of video game players. Future studies on the current topic are, therefore, recommended. Moreover, in line with the previous study ([Cui et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib30)), negative reviews are more influential than positive reviews, which further supports the existence of the negativity bias ([Paul Rozin and Edward B. Royzman, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib88)) in the e-commerce context. Additionally, in contrast to earlier findings ([Kim and Gupta, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib65)), while the ratio of extreme positive valence enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales, the moderating role of the ratio of extreme negative valence is not found. A possible explanation for this is that video game players might generally have high self-brand connections, who attribute negative emotions internally to reviewers’ personal disposition rather than to the reviewed products.\n\n5. Implications\n---------------\n\n### 5.1. Theoretical implications\n\nThis research makes several theoretical contributions to the e-commerce literature.\n\nFirst, our research reveals that review informativeness fully mediates the influence of product description informativeness on product sales. This empirical finding is an important complement to the previous [normative model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/normative-model "Learn more about normative model from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") of the interactions between seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context ([Chen and Xie, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib23)). This finding confirms the viewpoint of previous researchers: sellers are losing control over their brands and products ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)) because the information in the description they created can no longer directly influence product sales. Nevertheless, the situation is not so adverse: the text content that sellers create can still influence product sales with the help of information from customer reviews.\n\nSecond, previous empirical studies on the joint influence of seller-created and buyer-created content take place in either social media ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)) or the tourism ([Chen and Chang, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib20)) context. In turn, our research is one of the pioneer studies to quantify the influences of both seller-created and buyer-created content in the e-commerce context. Therefore, the results of this research reveal better the economic value of the two types of content on e-commerce platforms.\n\nThird, we found that previous researchers either used dual processing theory ([Topaloglu and Dass, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib100)) or dual coding theory ([Yang et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib109)) to approach their objectives in the e-commerce context. In contrast, our research highlights the necessity to combine both theories when studying various marketing phenomena in the e-commerce context. The reason behind this logic is that e-commerce platforms contain diverse components on the same product page, and omitting either theory may weaken the explainability.\n\n### 5.2. Practical implications\n\nThis research also makes several practical contributions to e-commerce markers and researchers.\n\nFirst, we used the bigram analysis to develop the lexicons of video game attributes. The developed lexicons help to understand and study the attributes of video game products, which have several practical applications, including product development, product maintenance ([Lawless and Civille, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib68)), [marketing research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/marketing-research "Learn more about marketing research from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)), and video game research ([Bedwell et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib9); [Marlow et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib78); [Wilson et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib106)). For instance, with the assistance of our lexicons, researchers are able to conduct replication studies to verify whether the established knowledge from other contexts ([Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98); [Yi and Oh, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib110)) are applicable in the video game context, which is a process that is increasingly valued by marketing researchers ([Easley et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib33); [Evanschitzky and Scott Armstrong, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib37)). Moreover, our lexicons can also serve as a corpus that allows video game researchers to develop a more parsimonious taxonomy of video game attributes, which remains a research gap in the video game literature ([Marlow et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib78)).\n\nSecond, our results align with the viewpoint that sellers are losing control over their brands and products with the presence of customer reviews ([Hennig-Thurau et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib54)). Therefore, relying exclusively on markers’ own content may not be the most effective way to drive product sales ([Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)). Nevertheless, practitioners can still increase product sales by describing in detail their products, as the informativeness in product description increases the informativeness in customer reviews, which eventually drives product sales. Moreover, markers are encouraged to incorporate more images of their products on the product page, which directly drives product sales.\n\nThird, the results indicate that informativeness and readability of customer reviews are two crucial factors that drive product sales in e-commerce platforms. Therefore, markers should attach great importance to buyer-created content. In line with the suggestions from previous researchers ([Choi and Lee, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib27); [Goh et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib46)), we also recommend practitioners implement an appropriate marketing initiative that combines seller-created and buyer-created content. Specifically, marketing managers are encouraged to consider developing customer incentive programmes like Amazon Vine,[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn9) in which the informativeness and readability in the reviews that participants write should be highly valued.\n\n6. Limitations and future research\n----------------------------------\n\nDespite the implications that this research offers, some limitations are identified.\n\nFirst, the empirical model of this research specifies the inter-relationships between the key components of seller-created and buy-created content that affect product sales. However, according to the standpoint of [social cognitive theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/social-cognitive-theory "Learn more about social cognitive theory from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Bandura, 1986](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib7)), individuals’ behaviour is not only influenced by environmental factors (which are included in this research) but also is influenced by personal factors (e.g., cognition, beliefs, skills, affects). Therefore, we encourage future researchers to extend our conceptual framework by incorporating [psychometric](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/psychometrics "Learn more about psychometric from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") factors, such as attitude and behavioural intention. This approach helps to reveal the [reciprocal interactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/reciprocal-interaction "Learn more about reciprocal interactions from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") among the three sets of influences in the e-commerce context.\n\nSecond, we observed the mediating role of review informativeness between product description informativeness and product sales. However, as this is an [observational study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/observational-studies "Learn more about observational study from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"), it is not possible to estimate the causal effect of buyer-created content on product sales. The casual inference is important in the marketing discipline because researchers are interested in certain exposures to customer behaviour ([Varian, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib101)). Future researchers are encouraged to adopt the following approaches to make causal inferences for the results of our research. On the one hand, as randomised controlled trials are considered the gold standard approach ([Austin, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib5)), it is recommended to replicate our study in the experimental setting. On the other hand, researchers can also use [propensity score matching](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/propensity-score-matching "Learn more about propensity score matching from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") to analyse the observational data to mimic some characteristics of a randomised controlled trial ([Austin, 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib5)).\n\nThird, we detected the double-edged role of buyer-created images. We speculate that buyer-created images can also convoy positive or negative valence. Computer vision techniques have been used to automatically classify images on social media for [marketing research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/marketing-research "Learn more about marketing research from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Argyris et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib4)). Therefore, in future research, it is recommended to use deep learning algorithms to automatically classify the images with positive or negative valence and explore their relationships with product sales when the corresponding training set in the e-commerce context is available. Moreover, in line with previous researchers ([Hartmann et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib53)), we also encourage future researchers to monitor closely the development of commercial cloud computing services, like the image classification algorithm of the AWS[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#fn10), which may be another solution to approach the research objective.\n\nForth, we focused on products in the video games category on the [electronic commerce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/e-commerce "Learn more about electronic commerce from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") platform. Products from the mentioned category are experience goods, which require sampling or purchase to evaluate the product quality ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Customer reviews are essentially crucial for buyers before purchasing experience goods like video games ([Zhu and Zhang, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib115), [2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)), which makes this product category adequate to study the mediating and moderating roles of the factors derived from both seller-created and buyer-created content. Nevertheless, the [sample selection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/sample-selection "Learn more about sample selection from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages") is double-edged. Customer reviews are expected to influence product sales only when consumers’ reliance on customer reviews is sufficiently high, which is further influenced by product characteristics ([Zhu and Zhang, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib114)). Therefore, although results in this research are expected to generalise to experience goods, future researchers are suggested to verify whether the results of this research are generalisable to search goods, such as digital cameras, laser printers, and [mobile phones](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mobile-phone "Learn more about mobile phones from ScienceDirect\'s AI-generated Topic Pages"). Unlike experience goods, consumers have the ability to obtain information on product quality before purchasing search goods ([Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81)). Especially, researchers are encouraged to determine whether product type (experience/search goods) serves as a moderator between the essential factors and product sales in this research, as product type has been verified as an important moderator between various factors and the helpfulness of customer review ([Filieri et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib40); [Mudambi and Schuff, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib81); [Sun et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bib98)).\n\nDeclaration of competing interest\n---------------------------------\n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\n\nWe acknowledge the financial support for this research from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [Project number: [PID2019-108554RB-I00](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#gs1)] and the Public University of Navarre.

Therefore, sellers must convey quality cues that are readily identifiable to such consumers. However, thanks to major technological advances and the development of social interaction systems on e-commerce platforms, individuals can now access large volumes of information (reviews, opinions, ratings) posted directly by fellow consumers, which can also provide cues by which to judge product quality, pre-purchase. Based on dual-process theory and signaling theory, the objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the heuristic or systematic cues related to electronic word-of-mouth on consumer perceived product quality, to determine how this quality affects perceived product performance risk and consumer purchase intention. A quantitative approach was taken using a structured online questionnaire. Data were collected from 835 consumers of e-commerce platforms and analyzed using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling and LISREL software. The results show that the quantity of reviews, source credibility, review usefulness, and brand experience all exert a positive and significant effect on perceived product quality, which, in turn, positively and significantly influences purchase intention. A negative and significant relationship between product performance risk and purchase intention is also found. The findings contribute to the literature by improving our understanding of those determinants of perceived product quality in e-commerce that motivate consumers to make a purchase and can help sellers improve their use of integrated social interaction tools to adequately reflect the quality of their products.    \n*   ### [Importance and performance in PLS-SEM and NCA: Introducing the combined importance-performance map analysis (cIPMA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924000195)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract This research offers a novel approach that extends the application of importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) in partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) by incorporating findings from a necessary condition analysis (NCA). The IPMA comprises assessing latent variables and their indicators\' importance and performance, while an NCA introduces an additional dimension by identifying factors that are crucial for achieving the desired outcomes. An NCA employs necessity logic to identify the must-have factors required for an outcome, while PLS-SEM follows an additive sufficiency logic to identify the should-have factors that contribute to high performance levels. Integrating these two logics into the performance dimension is particularly valuable for prioritizing actions that could improve the target outcomes, such as customer satisfaction and employee commitment. Although the combined use of PLS-SEM and NCA is a recent suggestion, this study is the first to combine them with an IPMA (i.e., in a combined IPMA; cIPMA). A case study illustrates the combined use of PLS-SEM and an NCA to undertake a cIPMA. This innovative approach enhances researchers\' and practitioners\' decision making, enabling them to prioritize their efforts effectively.    \n*   ### [How real-time interaction and sentiment influence online sales? Understanding the role of live streaming danmaku](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698924000894)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract Live streaming danmaku can reflect both real-time interaction and user sentiment, two key characteristics of live streaming e-commerce. Using a sentiment analysis of live streaming danmaku comments, our study explores the mechanism through which user-user interaction influences live streaming sales. We collect real world data including live streaming danmaku, user stay time, sales from the Douyin live streaming e-commerce platform (the Chinese version of TikTok). Quantifying user-user interaction with BERT model, we then perform a sentiment analysis using the Baidu API. The results of our analysis demonstrate that entertainment-type and information-type user interaction have a significant positive effect on flow, including user stay time, number of danmaku, number of people sending danmaku. Our study also identifies that number of danmaku and number of people sending danmaku play a partial mediating role between user interactions and live streaming sales. Furthermore, we find that user sentiment plays a positive moderating role in the relationships between several flow variables and user purchase behavior. Theoretically, our study proposes a new method to empirically analyze user behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Practically, in light of these findings, we propose several optimization strategies to enhance the interaction functions of live streaming commerce, so as to enhance user experience and stimulate purchase intention.    \n*   ### [The importance of online customer reviews characteristics on remanufactured product sales: Evidence from the mobile phone market on Amazon.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923004289)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services Citation Excerpt : \nFilieri et al. (2021) used PLS-SEM to find the usefulness of online customer reviews had beneficial impacts on customers’ satisfaction using data from TripAdvisor. The empirical results of Cai et al. (2023) showed that review readability had a direct effect on the sales of products, and review informativeness plays moderating role. Previous literature also concentrated on the connection between online customer reviews\' emotion and purchase behaviors or product sales (e.g., Guo et al., 2020).   Show abstract Remanufactured products have emerged as an important option for achieving sustainable development, which is crucial to the success of the circular economy. Consequently, it is necessary to investigate the influence of online customer reviews on remanufactured product sales, an aspect that has not been well understood in current research. In this study, we employed natural language processing methodologies, analyzing over 50,000 reviews from 2020 to 2021 on Amazon.com to explore the impacts of online customer reviews on remanufactured product sales. The findings indicate that the formal characteristics of online customer reviews, that is, review length and review valence have positive influences on remanufactured product sales. Furthermore, the content characteristics of online customer reviews, including the volume and valence of product usability, product service quality, and product cost performance, positively promote remanufactured product sales. Additionally, this study reveals three emotional characteristics of online customer reviews that significantly influence remanufactured product sales. Specifically, contentment and surprise positively affect remanufactured product sales, while anger negatively affects remanufactured product sales. The findings of this study provide useful insights for remanufactured product sellers to manage online customer reviews and develop marketing strategies.    \n*   ### [Customization at a glance: Investigating consumer experiences in mobile commerce applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923003533)\n\n2024, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services Citation Excerpt : \nTherefore, a comparison of opinions with each other within the same social group triggers SI. The identification among members with identical predilections significantly affects users to generate social presence, which in turn inclines them toward use behavior (Cai et al., 2023; Jaewon Choi, Lee, Sajjad and Lee, 2014). CUS based on social networking groups effectively provides recommendations from members to the target users (S. Li and Karahanna, 2012).   Show abstract The study strives to examine how customization (CUS) affects customers\' acceptance of m-commerce applications (MCA) and explore conditions where CUS would strengthen consumers\' behavioral intention (BI). The study aimed to bring insights for mobile commerce applications by testing the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) factors as mediators between customization and behavioral use. Our findings manifest that CUS positively impacts BI; this effect, meanwhile, has been partially mediated by the mediators illustrated in our model. Most importantly, all our evidence points out that CUS is key to understanding a customer\'s intention to adopt MCA. Unsurprisingly, products and services will be more helpful with CUS than with homogeneity in enhancing customers\' BI to adopt MCA. Indeed, CUS\'s effect on BI is mediated by a wide range of mediated factors. Our results indicate that UTAUT2 factors influence customers\' intentions to adopt MCA. Hence, this study considers it a significant value addition to the theory and practice.    \n*   ### [Return freight strategies and selling formats in e-commerce supply chain: The perspective of consumer fairness concerns and online shopping returns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698923002400)\n\n2023, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services  Show abstract Returns and consumer fairness concerns put a huge pressure on manufacturers who sell their products online. The optimal selling format and return freight strategy become particularly important for manufacturers in an e-commerce supply chain. Therefore, we build game models for the following scenarios under different selling formats: the seller bearing the return freight costs or the return-freight insurance premiums, consumers buying insurance for themselves, and no one buying insurance. By comparing the optimal solutions of the game models under reselling and agency formats, several conclusions are derived. In the agency format, if the return-freight insurance premium is higher than a particular threshold, then the optimal strategy of the manufacturer is to decrease the selling price to encourage consumers to purchase the insurance, otherwise, the manufacturer should purchase the insurance. As the level of consumer fairness concerns and platform commission rates increase, the manufacturer should gradually move from the agency to reselling format. In the reselling format, if the return-freight insurance premium is lower than a particular threshold, then consumers will purchase insurance and this will make the platform more profitable, and conversely, the platform should bear the return freight costs.    \n\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-85138218423&md5=8550dee2cfdbbe7d58ea332aaf687d6)\n\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096969892200234X#bfn1)\n\nIn this article, we call the informativeness embedded in buyer-created content as review informativeness, and that from seller-created content as product description informativeness.
